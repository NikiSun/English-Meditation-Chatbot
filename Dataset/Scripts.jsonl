This exercise can be used in these moments to help settle the mind and body as you prepare for sleep. Standing next to your bed, take a few deep breaths. <break time='4s'/> Center yourself in the present moment,  bringing your awareness to the body as it is right now. When you climb into bed, remain aware of what is occurring in the body. As you lie down, feel the body assume a resting position. Use the breath to bring mindfulness to the body and cultivate relaxation. As you breathe in, <break time='4s'/> feel the lungs fill with air.

Start a body scan at the top of the head, moving down the body to the toes. As your attention rests on each part, relax it and soften into the bed with every exhale. When you reach your toes, return to the body as a whole and the practice of breathing deeply. Continue softening. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

Allow yourself to get comfortable, relaxing the body and settling the mind. Let's start out today with a few deep breaths. So, breathing in deeply, <break time='4s'/> and breathing out slowly, <break time='4s'/> another deep breath in, <break time='4s'/> and a deep breath out, <break time='4s'/> letting all the tiredness, stress, and tension make its way out of your body, settling in, finding that place of stillness. Today's practice will be another guided visualization, using imagery to calm the mind and cultivate inner peace and balance. The imagery we'll be using today is that of a mountain. Bring to mind the image of a tall, beautiful, magnificent mountain, reaching high up into the heavens, touching the clouds. Feel your body as if it were this mountain, majestic, serene, yet grounded, stable. Become aware of all the places where your body touches the mattress beneath you, feeling that as the base of this mountain, rooting into the earth. With each in breath, <break time='4s'/> feel the belly rise as you visualize the rising of this mountain up into the sky, and with each out breath, <break time='4s'/> feel the belly fall, feeling the stability growing, rooting into the Earth, knowing that this mountain is so stable. There might be strong winds, there might be thunderstorms and lightning, rain, even fire. But even amidst all this chaos, the mountain is strong, unmovable. Feeling into that sense of depth and support and stability. And feeling into your body. Feeling the heaviness and the pull of gravity and how stable your body is. Just like the tall majestic mountain. And bringing an image of this mountain to mind, you might imagine all the trees and the plants, and the flowers that exist on this mountain. What kind of trees are on your mountain? And you can imagine wind flying through and connecting it to the rhythm of your breath. A gentle wind. Seeing the trees move gently in the wind. And imagining all the different animals that might exist on your mountain. What kind of animals do you see? Different birds and cats and bugs. What else do you see? Feeling your body rooting to the ground. Your connection with the Earth. No matter what comes, the mountain is strong. Letting the wind and the rain come and go. Nothing can disturb your peace. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

Allow yourself to find a comfortable posture in your bed, taking a few moments to get settled in your body and in your mind. Let your body fully relax. Begin by extending and lengthening the breath. Take a deep breath in, <break time='4s'/> and a slow deep breath out. <break time='4s'/> One more time. Deep breath in, <break time='4s'/> and a breath out. <break time='4s'/> From there, allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm. There's no need to control the breath, so let the body breathe itself. Let go of control, and fire up the quality of mindfulness and awareness, focusing it on the breath. Just become aware of your body and all the movements in the body, the physical sensations associated with breathing. For today's practice, we'll focus on noticing thoughts, becoming aware of thoughts. There's a useful metaphor we can use thoughts are like clouds floating in the sky. There's no need to push them away or fight them, just notice them as they pass through, like clouds in the sky.  Start by following the breath, feeling the in breath <break time='4s'/> and the out breath, <break time='4s'/>  watching the movement of the breath. Rising and falling. In and out. And at some point, you'll notice that you've gotten lost in thought. And when this happens, without any judgement, just notice that thinking is happening. No need to push away the thoughts but just let them be. As if you were suddenly aware of being immersed in a cloud in the sky. Letting the cloud drift away and reorienting your attention back to the breath. As you follow the breath, it can be helpful to use just a soft label. So, as you breathe in, you can quietly in your mind say, breathing in <break time='4s'/>. And as you breathe out, quietly in your mind say, breathing out <break time='4s'/>. Breathing in <break time='4s'/>, breathing out <break time='4s'/>. Breathing in <break time='4s'/>, breathing out <break time='4s'/>. And again, noticing when your mind wanders off. And without any self judgment, just notice, ah, thinking. Reorienting your attention and coming back to the body, coming back to the breath. In this mindfulness practice it's sort of like this dance. Noticing what's arising, noticing your thoughts and noticing the breath. But allow yourself to be relaxed and at ease with all this noticing. Allowing yourself to settle into sleep. When you notice thoughts coming, just let them come. Inviting them in. Letting them stay as long as they want to stay. And then letting them float and drift away. Nothing to hold on to, nothing to push away. Just like clouds in the sky. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

So, breathing in deeply, <break time='4s'/> filling the belly and the lungs. And breathing out slowly. <break time='4s'/> One more time. A deep breath in, <break time='4s'/> filling the lungs completely. And a slow breath out, <break time='4s'/> letting all the air out. Letting the breath return to its natural rhythm.

Watching the waves come in and watching the waves flow out. You might envision or imagine yourself laying down in the sand, just at the water's edge. And as the tide rolls in, you feel the water touching your body starting at the feet, moving up the legs and the arms until it touches the back of your head. And then as the water rolls out, moves down the body. Staying, if you can, with this movement, feeling the water crash in, working its way up your body and then the water pull back into the ocean. See if you can imagine hearing the ocean waves, the sound of the waves as the water crashes in. And the sound of the waves as it pulls out. Feeling the texture of the sand and the water beneath you. As you look up into the dark night sky. The stars are overhead. And the night is calm and peaceful, just the sound of the waves and the feeling of your breath and the stars above. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

In today's practice we'll be using the technique of counting and counting our breaths. But before we do that, we can take some time to get settled. So, finding a nice comfortable posture. Perhaps laying on your back. Eyes at the ceiling or eyes closed. You can place your hands at your sides or on your belly. Just finding a nice comfortable position. And starting with a few deep breaths. Breathing in deeply <break time='4s'/> and breathing out slowly <break time='4s'/>. One more time. A deep breath in <break time='4s'/> and a deep breath out <break time='4s'/>. Maybe one more just at your own pace. Inhaling and filling the lungs <break time='4s'/> and exhaling and letting it all out <break time='4s'/>. Allowing yourself to fully relax. And taking a moment just to allow your body to settle into the cushion or the mattress. As if you were a stone dropped into a pond. Slowly floating to the bottom. Finding that final resting place. Coming to a place of stillness in the body. And coming to a place of stillness in the mind. And becoming aware of the breath. Perhaps tuning into your anchor point. Wherever you feel the breath most clearly. Noticing the rise and fall of the belly. Or the expansion and contraction of the chest. Or the feeling at the entrance of the nostrils. And for this counting technique, what we'll be doing is counting our breaths up to 10. And then when you get up to 10 you can start again at 1. And if you lose track of the breath at any point, if you get lost in thought or distracted, just start again at 1. So, what that will look like is this: Breathing in <break time='4s'/>, breathing out <break time='4s'/>, 1 . Breathing in <break time='4s'/>, breathing out, 2 <break time='4s'/>. Breathing in <break time='4s'/>, breathing out <break time='4s'/>, 3. Breathing in <break time='4s'/>, breathing out <break time='4s'/>, 4. Breathing in <break time='4s'/>, breathing out <break time='4s'/>, 5. And you can continue at your own pace, following your own breath and your own timing. If you get lost in thought or find yourself losing count, just a reminder that you can start again at 1. And really see if you can let go of any judgement or criticism. Each time, just starting again, patiently and with gentleness. There's no need to judge yourself for losing track. So, starting again. Breathing in <break time='4s'/>, breathing out <break time='4s'/>, 1. Breathing in <break time='4s'/>, breathing out <break time='4s'/>, 2. Following your own breath and your own timing. As you count your breaths, see if you can stay connected with the feeling or the sensation of your breath in your body. Letting the counting be very soft and quiet in the background. As most of your attention stays with the physical sensations of the breathing. So, as you breathe in, feeling the in breath. And as you breathe out, feeling the out breath. But continuing to count up to 10 and then starting again at 1. As your mind begins to settle, you may start to feel sleepy or drowsy and just allowing that sleep to come. Letting the counting drift away. And letting yourself fall deeply into sleep. </speak>.","weight": 1}]}

Imagine a golden light emanating from your heart, warming your body from its center. Feel this golden light spread throughout your body. And soak in gratitude for its love, its magic, its life giving energy. And relax your body a little more into your bed. Now soften your stomach. If there's any discomfort, let your inbreath soothe it <break time='4s'/>. As your outbreath releases it <break time='4s'/>. And just relax your stomach deeper into sleep. Now feel the warmth on your back as you bring your attention to it. Imagine a warm glow softening all the muscles in your back. Allowing them to relax deeper into your comfortable sleeping position. Feel that warm energy travel down to your legs. Into your hips, your thighs, your knees, your ankles, your feet, and your toes. Feel the heaviness of your legs on your bed. Imagining them melting, melting, melting deeper into sleep. Your body is amazing. And she has given you the blessing of working for you today. Even through pain, discomfort, and challenges.

I recommend doing this meditation in your bed while lying down and allowing yourself to fall asleep to the meditation. So, just a reminder to always put your phone on airplane mode or on do not disturb before beginning. To start out, you can take some time to find a nice comfortable position, a nice laying down posture in your bed. Perhaps laying on your back or laying on your side. Whatever posture or position feels most comfortable for you. And perhaps closing your eyes. And you can also keep your eyes open and just have a soft gaze towards the ceiling.

Taking a deep breath in <break time='4s'/>and a deep breath out. <break time='4s'/> And just allowing your whole body to soften and relax. Letting all the tension release from the body. And if you're lying on your back, you might try placing one hand on your belly, your abdomen, and your other hand on your chest.

Just noticing what you're experiencing in the body. Feeling the movement of the belly and the chest. And for this guided practice today, we can focus on just settling and relaxing. Letting go of any tension or tightness from the body. You might bring your awareness to your face, all the muscles in your face. Starting with the forehead, just noticing if there's any tension or tightness in the forehead. Is it possible to soften, relax and release? Checking in with the muscles around the eyes and the eye sockets. What would it be like to relax? To soften the eyes? And bringing that attentive awareness down to the cheeks. Softening the cheeks. Relaxing the tongue. And unclenching the jaw. It can be helpful to keep your mouth closed and continue breathing in and out through the nose. Feeling the air come in and go out through the nostrils. And continuing down the body, relaxing as you go, releasing tension. So, moving down the neck and into the shoulders. Letting go of tension in the shoulders, letting the shoulders drop, sinking down into the mattress beneath you. Feeling the chest open. Becoming aware of the arms and the hands. Letting the whole body settle into the mattress. Becoming aware of that sense of gravity gently pulling you down from below. Feeling your body sinking into the mattress and also into a state of restfulness. With every out breath, feeling the body letting go just a little bit further. Releasing all the troubles and worries from the day. And if you notice your mind starting to wander, you can just let it wander or you can guide your attention back to your abdomen. Once again, feeling that rise and fall of the belly or the chest. Breathing in and feeling the in breath <break time='4s'/>. And breathing out and feeling the out breath <break time='4s'/>. Giving yourself full permission to just rest and relax. There's nothing you need to do and nowhere you need to go. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

Begin by lying on your back with your hands on your thighs or at your sides. You can change positions any time you need to in order to be more comfortable but start by lying on your back for now. Mentally scan your body for areas of tension. Make note of how your body feels. During this sleep relaxation session, you will focus on releasing any tension in your body and on quieting the mind. Once the mind is calm and peaceful, you will easily drift into pleasant, restful sleep. Breathe in, drawing in life giving air and relaxation <break time='4s'/>. Exhale slowly, expelling any tension <break time='4s'/>. You might have thoughts about things you did today, or things you need to do tomorrow. Perhaps you are worried about something or someone. Now is the time to clear your mind for sleep so tomorrow you will be refreshed and strong and can handle your duties and roles. Now take a few moments to do the thinking you need to do before you sleep. Focus now on anything you need or want to think about before you go to sleep. For the next two minutes, do any worrying or thinking you decide to do. Now it is time to clear your mind for sleep. There is nothing else you need to be doing at this moment. Nothing you need to be thinking, except calm, relaxed thoughts. Notice how your body feels right now. Where in your body is today's tension stored? Focus your attention on the part of your body that feels most tense. Focus in on one small area of tension. Breathe in deeply <break time='4s'/>, and then let that tension go as you breathe out with a sigh <break time='4s'/>. Notice where your body feels most relaxed. Let that feeling of relaxation grow with each breath. Spreading further and further, the feeling of relaxation. Feel your attention drifting as you become sleepy and calm. For the next few moments, you can choose to focus on counting and become more relaxed as each number passes through your mind. Concentrate your attention on the number one. As you count from one to ten, you will become more deeply relaxed. As you relax, you can allow your mind to drift into pleasant, refreshing sleep. Count slowly with me. One, focusing on the number. Two, you are more deeply relaxed, deeper and deeper. Calm. Peaceful. Three, feel the tension leaving your body, relaxation filling your body and mind. Concentrating just on the numbers. Picture in your mind number four, very relaxed. A calm, tingly feeling of relaxation in your arms and legs very heavy, pleasantly heavy and relaxed. Concentrating on number five as you drift deeper and deeper. Calm. Six. Sleep washing over you. Peaceful. Deeply relaxed. Seven, your body and mind are very calm. Eight, so very pleasant and heavy. Nine, allowing your mind to drift easily. No direction, floating, relaxing. Ten, you are deeply relaxed.  Now you may count back down from ten to one.

Let's start by finding a comfortable position, laying down if you're able. When you're ready, close your eyes. Take a second to settle in. Now, turn your attention to your breath, not trying to force anything, just noticing that you're breathing, the natural rhythm, the way your chest rises on the inhale, and falls on the exhale, the coolness as you breathe in, and the warmth as you breathe out. Just continue to breathe. Now, let's take some slow deep breaths, breathing deeply from the belly, filling the lungs, <break time='4s'/> and then slowly breathing out <break time='4s'/>. In <break time='4s'/> and out <break time='4s'/>. With each exhale, try and let go of any tension you might be feeling. In <break time='4s'/> and out <break time='4s'/>. Letting go of the day with each out breath, your body becoming heavier as you sink deeper and deeper. Now, let your breath ease back into its natural rhythm, noticing how fully you can relax when you simply rest in the inflow and the outflow of the breath. In and out. Letting go of the cares of the day, feeling your body becoming soft and loose, sinking even deeper, feeling the sensations of letting go, breathing in and out. Now, as you continue to breathe, direct your attention to your head, releasing any tension you're feeling, softening your forehead and temples, letting your eyes become heavy, relaxing your jaw and mouth, letting your lips and your tongue soften, your mouth fall slightly open. Now shift your attention to your neck, noticing any tension or soreness.  On your next exhale, let it go. Feel the muscles in your neck relax as your head sinks deeper into your pillow or whatever surface you're on. Continuing with your relaxing breath, move your focus to your shoulders, letting them drop, feeling as the tension dissolves, as your body sinks deeper. With your next breath, gently move to your back, softening your muscles as you breathe, letting the tension melt away, vertebrae by vertebrae as you scan down the back, breathing in and out sinking deeper. Now, turn your attention to your arms, letting them fall loosely to the sides, releasing any tightness in your upper arms, your forearms, your wrists. Soften your hands, your fingers, noticing any tingling or sensations as you relax. Now, turn your mind's eye to your chest, feeling it expand as it fills with relaxing breath, feeling your whole upper body soften as you let go. Next, move down to your belly, observe how it rises and falls, letting it soften with each breath. Now lower your attention to the pelvis, buttocks, and hips, letting your hips fall open, and any tension or tightness melt away, allowing yourself to sink deeper and deeper. Just keep breathing, in and out. With your next breath, shift your attention to your legs, softening your thighs, your knees, your calves, feeling them become heavy as you let go. Continue to inhale and exhale, then move your attention to your feet, let them fall to the side, your toes relax, noticing any coolness, heat, or tingling. Just sensing what's there, and then letting go. Keep breathing. As you rest safely in the breath, let your awareness spread throughout your entire body, heavy and relaxed, your muscles soft and loose. If you still feel any tension, just let it exit as you exhale, imagine it drifting off into the night sky. You're safe and relaxed in this moment, in this breath. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

See if you can allow yourself to get sleepy, without getting distracted. Find a comfortable and safe place to lie down. Choose any position you'd like, although it's best if the spine remains neutral. Close your eyes, and turn your attention inward. Get present with awareness of your own body, and your breath. Breathe slowly and softly in <break time='4s'/> and out through your nose <break time='4s'/>. As you rest here, imagine your whole entire body as a body of light. White light, or any color that speaks to you. Feel and sense the body as if it's glowing, warm and vibrant with light. Let this light fill up each little detail of your form. Let it fill you all the way down into your fingers and toes. Light in your ears, nose, and mouth. Light in your lungs, as you quietly breathe in <break time='4s'/> and out <break time='4s'/>. As you rest here, perhaps some of the light seeps out of your pores or out the crown of your head, filling the area around you with a glow. Softening, the boundaries between your body, and your bed, or the space around you. And then bring awareness to the crown of your head. Intentionally, we begin the process of saying goodnight. Of turning off the lights, and further resting back. As you say goodnight, imagine the light from the crown of your head becoming slowly absorbed again by the body. The light around your head begins to dim. The light within your head begins to dim And as it gets darker, it doesn't become darkness. It simply dissolves, vanishes, disappears. And as this light dissolves, so too, does your awareness of the crown of your head. As the light dissolves, so too does your consciousness. All of it, gently, dissolving into the vastness of the space around you. Or further back into your bed. Or deeper down into your subconsciousness. Where it will rest until morning. Feel this dissolving in your forehead, behind your eyes, between your ears. The light slowly dimming in your nose, mouth, face. The light slowly dimming in your throat, and your neck. All the while, present with a feeling of softening, letting go, and releasing. As you say goodnight to this light. Notice and watch the dimming in your shoulders, upper back, and upper chest. Drop awareness of these parts, as you follow this light further downward. Watching the dissolving in your upper arms, elbows, lower arms, and hands. As you say goodnight to each part of the body. See the light dissolve from each finger. One by one, or all together, from the base of the hand to the tips. And then there's no more awareness of the fingers and the hands. As we bring awareness back to the lower chest, belly, and low back. As the light here dims down, the body itself is now free to become one. With wide open space, or your bed. The body itself dissolving into dreamland. Where your dream body is waiting to meet you. Watch or sense the light dissolving in your hips , your buttocks, your thighs. And as you follow this disappearing light, follow too, your softening consciousness. Awareness itself dropping back. Let it drop back behind you, or further down into your toes. See now, the light in your knees, your lower legs, feet, and toes. Fading, dimming. Follow it until the very last pinprick of light disappears from the tips of each toe. The body no longer your form body, but free, unlimited, and spacious. The body now your dream body. The body now sleeping, resting, and completely at ease. So too, the mind, consciousness, awareness. Now free, now at ease. Nowhere, and everywhere. Recharging, reconnecting. Rest and sleep. Trusting, that when you awaken, you'll awaken back into your body of light. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

Getting comfortable in your bed. And in this practice today, we'll be continuing with the body scan practice but today we'll be adding in a little twist, so we'll be doing a gratitude body scan. So, as we move through the body, scanning through, we'll be sending some gratitude and appreciation. Appreciating what the body does for us, being grateful for it. So, you may want to lay on your back for this meditation. Looking up towards the ceiling. Arms at your sides. Letting your belly be soft. And letting the breath be natural. So, there's no need to control the breath. See if you can sink a little bit lower into the mattress. Can you let gravity pull you down? And connecting with the full body. Can you feel the general outline or shape of your body? What does it feel like to have a body? And we can start this gratitude body scan by bringing our attention to the top of the head, the area of the scalp or the crown of the head. And as we go through, just inviting that sense of gratitude for the role that each of these body parts plays in our life. So, starting at the top of the head and feeling the skull and the scalp. And perhaps sending some gratitude for the protection that it provides. Thank you for keeping my brain safe. Moving down the forehead, becoming aware of the eyes and the eye sockets. Sending gratitude for the gift of sight. Thank you for giving me the ability to see. Thank you. Moving down and feeling the nose and the nostrils. Sensing. And giving gratitude for the sense of smell. Thank you for allowing me to smell. And moving down towards the mouth. Feeling the lips, and the teeth. Feeling the tongue. And as you sense into that area, giving thanks for all the different things that the mouth provides. Thank you for the ability to taste. Thank you for giving me the gift of speaking. Thank you for the gift of chewing. Sending gratitude for your mouth. And slowly moving your awareness down the chin and into the neck. Feeling the different muscles of the neck. And giving gratitude. Thank you for supporting my head. Thank you. And moving down and feeling both shoulders. Down the biceps and the triceps. Feeling into the elbows and the forearms. The wrists. The palms of the hands. And feeling into all the fingers. And giving gratitude for all that you are able to do with your arms and hands. Thank you for giving me the gift of touching and feeling, for grasping, for writing and typing. Appreciating your arms and hands in whatever way feels right to you. Thank you. And moving your awareness back up through the arms and into the chest. Feeling the lungs and giving gratitude. Thank you for the gift of breathing. Feeling the rise and fall. As you move down and feel your heart. The area of the solar plexus. Thank you for beating. Thank you for bringing blood to the rest of my body. Thank you. And moving down and feeling into the abdomen and reflecting on the stomach and the intestines. Thank you for the gift of digestion. Even if you don't always work as I like you to. For the most part, you are functioning, allowing me to gain strength from the food I eat. Thank you for being there. And moving your awareness down into the pelvis and feeling your sexual organs. Sending gratitude for all that they have offered you in your life. For all the times of pleasure and joy and connection. Thank you. Moving your awareness down into the hips. Feeling the hips and giving gratitude for allowing you to move. Thank you for taking me places. Moving your awareness through the backside and into the buttocks. Thank you for giving me a comfortable seat. For always supporting me. Moving your awareness down through the knees, into the shins and calves, through the ankles and resting in the soles of your feet. Can you send gratitude to your feet? Always supporting you no matter where you go, they carry you. So, thank you. Thank you for the gift of movement and walking. And expanding your awareness out into the rest of the body. And sending gratitude for any place that feels left. Anywhere else that you recognized deserves some appreciation. And then letting the body rest. Letting the body take a break and recuperate. Allowing yourself to fall into sleep. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

Taking some time to prepare your body and your mind for sleep. In this guided practice today, we'll be doing a body scan meditation. So, for this one, you'll want to find a position laying on your back, arms at your side or on your belly or chest. And you can have your eyes open or closed. If they're open, just having a soft gaze towards the ceiling. Or closing your eyes. And for today's body scan meditation, it is really focusing on developing curiosity. So, really getting curious about what you're feeling in each different part of the body. And if there's no feeling, then just allowing space for there to be no feeling. And starting as we usually do with a few deep breaths. So, breathing in deeply <break time='4s'/> and breathing out slowly <break time='4s'/>. Releasing all tension from the body. One more deep breath in <break time='4s'/> and a deep breath out <break time='4s'/>. Relaxing and sinking. Allowing yourself to come to a place of stillness. Feeling the weight of gravity pull you down. So, we can start this body scan at the top of the head. So, bringing your attention to the crown of the head. The area on top of the scalp and just rest it there for a while. Noticing what sensations you feel or experience. Can you feel that area? And what do you notice? Is there any tingling or vibration? If you feel nothing there, just making space for that as well. There's no need to force any feeling. And slowly letting your awareness drip down the top of the forehead. Feeling your way as you go down towards the eyebrows. And moving with curiosity towards the eye sockets. And resting your attention in the eyes. If there's tension, you can soften, or you can just make space for the tension. There's no need to change it. But just to get curious about what does it feel like. What do the eyes feel like in this moment? And moving your awareness down the nose and the cheeks. Feeling the outside of the cheeks and then the inside of the cheeks. Becoming aware of your teeth. And your tongue. Becoming aware of your jaw. There's nothing you need to do with this awareness but just feeling into the body. Cultivating and strengthening this body awareness. Slowly moving the attention down as if it were honey dripping down your body. So, moving down the neck, feeling the upper neck and then the lower neck. Down towards the right shoulder. Feeling the muscles of the deltoid on the right shoulder. As your awareness slowly moves into the right arm, feeling the right bicep and the right tricep. Moving your awareness through the right elbow. The right wrists and resting your attention in your right hand. Perhaps feeling the palm, any warmth and vibration. And perhaps feeling each finger one by one. The thumb, and then all the other fingers. And then slowly withdrawing that awareness from the right hand and the right arm as you travel up and over to the left side. Feeling the left shoulder. The muscles of the left shoulder. Moving down into the left bicep and the left tricep. To the left elbow. The left forearm and left wrists. And then bringing that full complete attention into the left hand. What is the experience of feeling into your left hand? Feeling the fingers of the left hand. Letting go of words and just experiencing directly the physical sensations. And slowly withdrawing your attention from the hands and the left arm. Moving slowly back up to the center of your chest. Feeling the area of the solar plexus and the sternum. Noticing any subtle rising and falling. The expansion and contraction of the ribcage. And moving down, feeling the abdomen. Noticing how your belly moves. Feeling the breath softening. And moving down through the pelvis. Feeling both thighs at the same time. The quadriceps. Feeling the hamstrings and the hips. Moving down through the kneecaps. Again, just staying curious. Connected to your own body. Moving down the tops of the shins. And feeling the calves. Feeling into both ankles. And then resting your attention in the soles of the feet. And again, being curious about a direct experience. And moving your attention from the soles of the feet and traveling back up towards the center of the body. Becoming aware of the solar plexus. And allowing your attention to stay there. With the gentle rising and falling. As you slowly drift off into sleep. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

First, I would like to invite you to get comfortable in a position that is restful, relaxed, and cozy. Take a nice, slow, deep breath in,<break time='4s'/> deeper than you've taken all day so far, and as you do, gently let your eyes close. As you exhale, feel all of the air leave your body.<break time='4s'/> Take another deep breath, even deeper than the one before it, and at the top of the breath, see if you can notice the stillness that exists there.<break time='4s'/> Exhale it out, and at the bottom of the breath, notice the stillness there as well.<break time='4s'/> Keep breathing this way, noticing this natural stillness that exists at the top and bottom of your breath, allowing it to ground you into the present moment, using it to still your energy. Give yourself permission, right now, to let go of everything else you were consumed with before we started. There is nowhere else you need to be, nothing else you need to do. Give your mind permission, right now, to wind down and rest. Continue taking slow, deep breaths,<break time='4s'/> feeling the journey of your breath through your entire body, breathing in and out of every muscle and cell,<break time='4s'/> from the top of your head to the tips of your toes. Notice any places where you may be holding stress or anxiety, any areas that might be sore or tight, and begin to breathe into them. Unfurrow your brow, unclench your jaw, open your palms. Notice any other places in your body where you may be holding tension, and breathe into them, allowing the breath to release it, giving the tension permission to let go. Now return your breath to its normal rhythm and pattern, but keep your focus on it, allowing it to be your anchor as you fall asleep. Now, let us set an intention for the kind of sleep we want. Often we lay in bed worried about not getting enough sleep or not getting good sleep, but what we focus on expands. So, we are going to avoid focusing on what we do not want, and instead, I invite you to set a positive intention for the kind of sleep you do want: a sleep that is peaceful, restful, deep, and relaxing. Really allow that intention to settle in now, and allow feelings of restfulness, peace, relaxation, and ease to come up for you. Sit with them. As we move into the silent part of the meditation, call to mind a few things that happened today or in the recent past that you're grateful for. Perhaps you're grateful for your health, your safety, or your willingness to take this time for self care. Take your time with each one, giving yourself the gift of sitting with that gratitude and pleasant feeling, allowing it to ease you closer to sleep. Sweet dreams </speak>","weight": 1}]}

It is common that a busy mind tries to keep you from making the leap from awake to sleep. So, I am going to give you one last chance to think about these things. One last chance to go through any worries, or concerns that you have, that are keeping you from getting a restful night's sleep. So, go ahead and think as hard as you can about anything that's stuck in your mind. But when you do this you only give each thought ONE chance to think about it, then you WILL let it go. As each thought arises that keeps you from feeling relaxed, say to that thought, ok, I've acknowledged you, so now you must leave. And continue. Think your thoughts, and only give them one chance to present themselves, and say, now it is time for you to go. As you watch these thoughts coming, notice how less repetitive they get. You are emptying these thoughts out by actively letting each of them go. If something arises that you already just thought about, demand that you are letting it go once and for all, because you deserve restful sleep. You have only a few moments longer to think of anything that's left, then letting it go completely. Restful sleep is natural for you, it is natural for everyone. However, up until now, you've allowed your thoughts to have control over you, keeping you from getting the slumber you deserve. But now you are done with this habit because restful sleep IS natural for you, and over thinking is unnecessary and unnatural. Good, you are doing exactly what you've been needing to for so very long. Only one last chance to see any thoughts coming and say to them, leave my mind, so that I can have the natural, restful sleep that I deserve. And as these daily concerns fade, and become less aggressive in your mind, you find your body feels lighter. You also find that your mind, too, feels lighter. A gentle floating sensation sweeps over you, and this is the most relaxed you've felt in a very long time. Good. You notice the slight sound of your gentle breath and it reminds you of a calm breeze, or a serene ocean or perhaps a clear stream, trickling by. Your breath is very similar to these scenes in nature, because your breath is the most natural thing in this world. Your breath slows a bit more, which means you are very relaxed and ready to doze off into a beautiful sleep. It's been so long since you've been able to fall asleep so easily, that your body welcomes this sensation. Your mind has been so kind in letting go of any repetitive thoughts, because you acknowledged them, and then firmly ordered for them to leave. Your mind listens very well to your instruction. Allow your mind to drift and wander to the thought of a soft, and fluffy pillow. You may be lucky enough to be laying on one right now. Just imagine this pillow and feel its softness supporting you. Feeling how it was created just for you to rest your head upon. The truth is, it was designed by someone who wished you a happy night's sleep, every night. Give thanks to the creator of this soft, comfy pillow. It is a very important tool in a restful sleep. The sound of my voice becomes distant now and the sensations of sleep are drawing very close now. The frequency of sleeping sweeps over your mind and is a very pleasant feeling. These gentle sensations come very naturally for you. You sleep deeply and soundly. You can almost sense the feeling of being a tiny baby, when sleeping came often and easily. When you were a baby, your breath filled your belly and soothed you. You were wrapped in various soft blankets by those who cared for you. People cared for you when you were a baby and were delighted to see you restfully sleeping. They knew how important it was to rejuvenate ourselves with sleep. They smiled as they watched your closed eyes and sweet face. You slept easily and nicely then, when you were a little baby, just as you do now, upon your soft pillow. You sleep deeply and soundly. You can barely notice your breath now because it has slowed to only what is needed for a deep and restful sleep. This is completely natural, and it feels wonderful. Good, I am very delighted to see you sleeping so well, you deserve this. You sleep deeply and soundly. You deserve a restful sleep. You deserve a natural slumber. You deserve to let go of unnecessary thoughts. You deserve to sleep in a way that you feel completely rejuvenated when you rise. Everyone you know also deserves to see you well rested, and they are overjoyed to hear this news when you tell them that you are getting the natural sleep that you need, every single night. You sleep deeply and soundly. Your dreams are constructive and offer a space for learning. Your dreams contribute to a happy wakeful life. Your dreams compliment your good qualities and offer feelings of completion. Let the dreamy feeling flow and float now, taking you all different kinds of wonderful places, having important experiences. You sleep deeply and soundly. Now, it is effortless for you to get to sleep. Simply practice this meditation technique every single night for a few weeks, so that you fully retain this wonderful habit. Good. Sleep comes easily for you. Sleeping soundly is natural for you. Those you love are delighted that you sleep so deeply, getting the rest you need. It is your human right to always get a good night's sleep. And it is your human right to be completely rejuvenated when you rise. You deserve this, and you always have. Now, just let my voice completely fade away, and enjoy this rest you naturally experience. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

Sleep allows our bodies to heal and our minds to sort through any problems, so that we can create our future. Hypnosis and meditation are wonderful ways for us to access a slower brain frequency state, that is similar to when we are sleeping. This allows for the creative brain to activate and begin the process of manifesting your desires. Are you ready to go into a very relaxing state to allow yourself the deep sleep every night that you deserve? Find a small spot to gaze at somewhere comfortably in front of you <break time='4s'/>. Focus on this spot and do not let your eyes turn away. As you look here, I am going to ask you to blink your eyes with every number I count, starting with the number 10. Ok. 10, blink your eyes <break time='4s'/>.  , blink <break time='4s'/>. 8, blink <break time='4s'/>. 7 <break time='4s'/>. 6<break time='4s'/>. 5 <break time='4s'/>. 4 <break time='4s'/>. 3 <break time='4s'/>. 2 <break time='4s'/>. 1 <break time='4s'/>. And zero <break time='4s'/>. Your eyes are ready to gently close so just allow them to, and you will notice when you do so a gentle wave of relaxation sweeps over you completely. Is getting a well rested night's sleep important for you? Extremely. Sleep is our rest state, and awake is the active state. We must have a good flow going between resting, and activating…. rest and activate….rest and activate……and we can achieve any goal we set forth. So just imagine now that in front of you there is a set of stairs going down. These stairs lead you to the knowledge of restful and rejuvenating sleep. When I begin to count down from 10, you will start to walk down these stairs, feeling more and more relaxed with each step you take. 10, begin your journey of insight into sleep <break time='4s'/>.   <break time='4s'/>. 8 <break time='4s'/>. Feeling so relaxed with each step. 7 <break time='4s'/>. 6 <break time='4s'/>. 5 <break time='4s'/>. More and more calm. 4 <break time='4s'/>. More and more relaxed in the mind. 3 <break time='4s'/>. 2 <break time='4s'/>. 1 <break time='4s'/>. As you step off the last step, you step into white sand. It's so soft and warm under your feet. Just feel the sensations you have in your feet on the sand. Now look up and all you see is more sand in front of you, but you can hear the ocean. Walk towards the sound of the ocean. As you're walking you can feel the sun on your skin. Perhaps you can feel a light breeze as well. You notice the smell of the salty air. And as you're looking around you see the ocean peek over the sand dune. You're walking towards the ocean now and you notice the sand under your feet gets firmer, because it's saturated with sea water. And you get to the shore where the ocean meets the sand, and you see little waves coming up and down. Up and down. And as the waves come and go, you see some things in the sand like shells, pieces of seaweed, your own footprints, and you see a little piece of driftwood that's the perfect size for writing in the sand with. Pick up this driftwood, now draw your name into the sand where it's moist. Write out each letter, noticing the sound that it makes as you scratch it though the sand. Good. Now step back and look at your name. As you see your beautiful name that's carried you through your whole life, you notice a little wave coming closer. This wave catches part of your name and washes it away as it goes back into the ocean. And then another wave comes and washes your way even more. And another comes and washes it away. And another, until all you can see is ripples in the sand where your name used to be. That's good. Now continue walking along your beach, noticing the surroundings. What kind of sounds do you hear? <break time='4s'/> Can you hear seabirds flying over? <break time='4s'/> Or the wind gently blowing? <break time='4s'/> Can you feel the warm sun on your skin? <break time='4s'/> How does the sand feel under your feet again? <break time='4s'/> It's nice, right. Maybe you can even smell the smells of the ocean. You find a fresh date, that's ready to eat. Bite into it and notice how delicious it is. Just be at your beach today, eating your fruit. Now as you've walked you've learned a lot about how beautiful this beach is and you're ready for a little rest. You look around and notice there is the perfect spot for you to lay down and take a gentle nap in the life giving sun rays. So go ahead and lie down. And before you close your eyes to rest, you look out into the ocean. Watch the horizon and how the ocean meets the sky. This is the most beautiful scene you've ever witnessed. As you gaze along the big blue, and allowing yourself to fall asleep naturally, you listen very closely to what I have to tell you because it is very important to your overall well being. Sleeping is natural for everyone. The only thing keeping you from getting the instinctual sleep that you deserve is your thoughts. You've allowed your mind to push you around, making you restless when you get in the bed, or thoughts keep coming louder and louder and repeat themselves over and over so loudly that you cannot possibly relax with that noise happening in your mind. But now, you are done allowing your mind to boss you around and control you. From now on, when an unwanted thought arises in your mind you say to it ENOUGH. STOP. And that is final. If another bothersome thought arises you immediately say ENOUGH. STOP. You will find that training the mind is like training a dog. They learn from making mistakes, and testing boundaries. Yet they will only listen to you if you train them. If you do not train your mind, it will soil your thoughts which keep you up at night. So let me say this again so that it is perfectly clear. When a negative or unwanted thought comes into your mind, no matter how many times it may repeat itself, you say, ENOUGH. STOP. Very good. And when a lovely, and relaxing thought comes, go into this visual as if it's a dream. Just like your nap on your beautiful beach. Good… Now float and drift into a restful and rejuvenating night's sleep and when you rise, you feel anew. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

You want a long meditation practice for helping sleep. Let me prepare the right practice for you.</speak>","weight": 0}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<speak> This simple meditation. Perhaps sometimes you may wish that there was an off button for your mind. An overly busy mind can halt us in many ways throughout our lives, and one of the main things a busy minds interrupts, for millions of people around the world, is a good night's sleep, every single night. Why is this so? To answer this, let's relax your mind just a little bit right now. Imagine that your mind is represented by a river, with waters that sometimes flow by slowly when there is a lack of rain, or sometimes very quickly depending on the weather and the time of year. Your mind is the river. Your thoughts are the water. How quickly is your river of the mind flowing right now? How fast are the thoughts, represented by water, flowing in the river? <break time='4s'/> Just watch this flow as if you are sitting on the riverbank, enjoying it. Good. Now just allow for the seasons to pass and the weather to change and watch your river change along with it. The seasons represent your overall happiness in your life. Are you achieving quarterly goals you set for yourself? <break time='4s'/> Seasons change but each one of them can be viewed as beautiful. Seasons can be tough, or they can be mild and enjoyable. The waters of the river represent your thoughts. When you focus your thoughts on your goals and desires, your river slows, and becomes crystal clear. The birds and the wildlife are able to see fish that they will catch to feed themselves and their offspring. The fish can find sources of foods because the waters have slowed enough to allow for bits of plants to settle on the water and soften, and live bugs can land on the water for them catch. Now for a moment imagine a storm of thoughts is coming for your river. See the waters rise and the animals scurry. The fish hide in safer areas and there are no bugs flying around. It is only rushing by a little faster now, yet the storm is building. The more thoughts you let into your mind, the more the waters rush by. It becomes a threatening river so quickly that you cannot sit on the bank watching your river any longer and observing the beauty. You must seek shelter from the storm. This storm of Thought has taken the ability to observe away from you. It takes a while for a storm of thoughts to pass, and even longer for the after effects of the storm to calm. The waters continue to rush at high speeds for several days or so. This is what happens when you allow a storm of thinking to enter your mind. It disrupts you for some time, until the waters can naturally settle. We want to always remain on the bank of our river, observing abundant nature and clear calm waters. We all know sleep is necessary and rejuvenating, so why do so many people suffer to achieve restful sleep? Because they do not take charge of their busy mind, moving it from worry to relaxation. Like I mentioned before, allowing a busy mind to go free is like never training a great horse. The mind needs to you be in control and needs you to train it how to work for you. A calmer state of mind allows for you to not only sleep better, but eliminates anxiety, increases focus, treats depression, stops circular thinking, improves your memory, betters your relationships, satisfies the body, and increases emotional intelligence. They key to attaining all these things is actually very simple, and natural for all of us. The key is to bring into our mind the awareness of all physical sensations, and bring into your mind your emotions, and bringing into your mind your thoughts; this is meditative, and simply doesn't allow for bothersome thoughts to have any power over you. Your ability to emotionalize and feel things is much more powerful than a busy mind. Your ability to create and ponder new ideas and a new self image supersedes a noisy mind. All a noisy mind is good at is distracting you. It doesn't achieve anything; it doesn't build on any new ideas; it doesn't emotionally connect with others around you; in fact, an overloaded and out of control mind acts to disconnect you from others, and from yourself. A bustling mind is tiring, yet it doesn't allow for you to rest. Giving up control of your mind is like feeding your child nothing but breads and sugar and candy. They are going to lose control because of the unhealthy information they are taking into their system. Let's put our mind now in the being mode right now by implementing positive affirmations. Say to yourself now, Thoughts are only thoughts. I live in the present, not in the past or in the future. I draw from my past when I need to plan for my future, but I always live in the present moment. I take notice of my body often throughout the day, easing and relaxing my body by doing so. I take notice of my surroundings to ease my mind. When thoughts begin to swirl in my mind, I have compassion for them and acknowledge them, knowing they are simply thoughts. My thoughts come and go. Everyone's thoughts also come and go, I am no different. When I watch my thoughts like the waters of a river, I never get caught in a thought, I am just a witness. Stopping my thoughts is impossible. Instead, I observe them arriving and leaving. Instead of jumping into thoughts emotionally, I observe which thoughts I want to cultivate more of. I know that which thoughts I put my energy to is what I create for myself. By taking the time to practicing these methods I really feel a difference. I have the patience to retrain my mind I retrain my mind so that I can get rest when I need it. I have patience when I'm training my mind, just as I would have patience training the most magnificent horse. I am kind to myself with this new way of being. I am kind to others and I never allow overthinking in the form of judgement to cloud my relationships. I am persistent because I know the rewards are well worth the effort. I see benefits right from the very start of my practice. Good. Now remember that each day you practice mindfulness techniques, the more restful and deep sleep that you receive each night. Just relax down even more now letting your body make any last adjustments it needs so that you get the most restful sleep every night of your life. Goodnight. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

A fully relaxed body makes sleep come easily and effortlessly. Make a fist with both of your hands and squeeze as hard as you can for 5 seconds <break time='4s'/>, Then let go completely. This is called tensing, or tense. Tense your entire arms, flexing every muscle in your arms for 5 whole seconds <break time='4s'/>. And release completely.

And relax your feet. Good. By doing this you activate, and then deactivate each muscle in your body, causing a continuous relaxation. Now just stop doing anything at all. Don't flex or relax anything, don't activate or rest any area, just allow yourself to be. Allow for your body to adjust to anything it sees is needed, allow for your body to have complete freedom from thought, let your body be in control of itself now, to heal what needs to be healed, or activate what needs to activate, or rest what needs to rest, it will do exactly as it needs now, without any effort or even your suggestions. This is the natural state of your body, when you allow the mind to step away from it. When your mind gets out of the way, our bodies can take charge in miraculous ways. Changing hormones, the very chemistry of our bodies, and even the structure of each of our cells. This is what sleep and rest are for. Sleeping fully allows for our mind to let go of the body so that it can regenerate. Allow for yourself to nap now, however long you feel you need to. So, right now, allow your body to do what it does best, to rest. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

I am going to guide you into a restful sleep by taking you on a relaxing train ride through the beautiful countryside. Find a comfortable position now and make sure that you will not be disturbed so that you get a restful sleep. Get as comfortable as you can now, and at any time along the way you need to reposition yourself to get even more pleasant sleep, you can do so. Begin to let go of all the tension you build up throughout the day. Any worries you accumulated seem to lose their power and intensity as you settle down for the night. Feeling cozy now, allow your breath to begin to slow down with each breath you take. A nice full breath in <break time='4s'/> and slowly exhale <break time='4s'/>. Letting your breath return to normal now, just observe your mind and how it is thinking of various things about your life and your day. Observe how perhaps visuals of moments flash in your mind or maybe you feel them, you may be able to hear sounds with your thoughts as they present themselves. Good. Letting images from your life fade now, bring into your imagination that you are walking towards a long train, that is parked along the countryside. The Engine of the train is stopped at an old station in the middle of nowhere, and the long train extends into the horizon. You are walking several sections back, and you notice an open wagon. You see the workers getting ready to depart, and steam is billowing out from the engine. You hop on the open wagon and find it is filled with fresh hay. You hear the train horn blowing, and the sounds of distant voices calling all aboard. You lay down in the hay and it is perfectly comfortable. You are positioned in a way that you are gazing out the open door into nature. As you sit back, waiting for the train to begin to roll, you look around the wagon and notice all the details. The weather is perfectly mild, and soothing. Perhaps you can sense the smell of hay and the countryside breeze. Notice everything as vividly as you can. You feel slight vibrations as the train powers up, and you can hear it's mighty engine hissing as it builds enough power to pull the massive weight. Soothing station bells begin to ring, alerting that the train is leaving the station. The wagon begins to roll, very slowly, and you take a deep breath of relief because you know you are in for a long, relaxing ride. The vibrations under you get stronger because the train is increasing in speed. You can hear the relaxing sounds of the wheels turning along the tracks. The station bells get louder as your wagon passes by this small station in the middle of nowhere, and then they pass by, and the ringing sounds get fainter in the distance until you cannot hear them any longer. The vibrations under you are strong, yet soothing. They even out into a relaxing hum, as the train has reached a safe and steady speed for a long journey. As you gaze outside, it is still light, but it will be sunset very soon. You can see out both sides of this train car, making for the most beautiful views you have ever seen. You see the ground close to you passing by very quickly. And the trees nearby passing a little slower, and in the distance, some rolling mountains are moving by ever so slowly as you ride. Look out into this nature and just really enjoy its beauty. The sun is beginning to meet the horizon, setting behind a soft, rolling mountain range in the distance. The colors that this sunset begins to create for you are breathtaking. The pinks and yellows of the sky fade into the bright blue, then into the deep blue of the night sky inching in. The gentle mountain range gives off hues of greens and blues, and grays. The sundown is reflecting colors of purples mixed with oranges now as it dips below the mountains. Meadows of warm golden colors are passing by the train and every now and then an old giant oak tree passes you by, standing proudly in the sprawling fields of gold. This view is mesmerizing, and you are not thinking about anything other than the beauty you are witnessing. You are getting more and more relaxed, and feeling grateful for these beautiful moments in the twilight upon this sleepy train. You are very comfortable and ready for a restful night's sleep. The aura of the sun is slowly fading away, and the night sky is chasing away the sunset. Your eyes are becoming heavy with sleep, as you watch the day turn to darkness. The wide meadows have passed by and the train is entering a forest. The weather cools just a bit and you can smell the trees as they close in around the train. Dark has settled in yet there is crisp moonlight peeking through the trees as they pass by. The hum and resonance of the train are very soothing to you, making you even more sleepy. Your eyes are closed now, and occasionally you open them for just a moment to gaze around the wagon and the view into nature. Now hear yourself saying, as you drift and float on this dreamy train ride, Sleep comes and it restores me and heals me. Nighttime is my time to fully rest and rejuvenate. A restful night's sleep is approaching, and I am just along for the ride I have done all that I need to do today. Right now, I don't have to do anything but sleep. I breathe peacefully and easily, relaxing my mind and body. Sleep comes over me naturally, and willingly. As I become more relaxed and sleepy, this gives my body the time to heal. I know how good this is for me right now. Deep and restful sleep is possible every night, when I let go of worries and stress. My breath is steady and slow, carrying me into a long night's sleep. As I become sleepier and sleepier, my brain slows, yet my creativity increases. This creative state is void of any of my worries or fears. It is completely open to showing me how to achieve my goals and attain my desires. I am grateful for my day that was well lived, and now it has become night. Through sleeping and dreaming, I accomplish great advances in my psyche, which extend into my waking life. Now it is my time to dream. I embrace rest as one of nature's natural healing medicines. My body feels very heavy and calm. My muscles are completely relaxed, and any remaining tension completely fades. My mind is quiet and clear. I enjoy waking up refreshed and rejuvenated after a marvelous sleep. I sleep well each and every night. Nothing disturbs me when I sleep. The more rest I get, the more excellent tomorrow will be. I thank my body for allowing this time of rest and relaxation. I thank my mind for letting go of worries and opening to resourcefulness through dreaming. No matter how much of my dreams I remember, I know that they are constructive and offer a space for my imagination to flourish. Dreaming and sleeping allow for great vision and inventiveness to take place in my mind. I release all my thoughts from the day. I release any tension I accumulated from the day. I awaken refreshed and happy when I have gotten the perfect amount of sleep that I need. I am grateful for my beautiful bed and pillow that support me. I am calm and full of peace. Falling asleep is effortless for me. I know that the words I say and the things I think come into action. I say with confidence every day that I sleep easily and restfully. Each night when I lay down on my soft pillow, I am greeted by sleep, and I welcome this sensation. I sleep so soundly that my body and mind are completely refreshed and ready to accomplish anything. I look forward to going to bed, knowing it will be quiet and relaxing. I look forward to doing all the little things I like to do to prepare for getting in the bed. I turn off all lights before getting in bed because darkness releases melatonin in my body, aiding in perfect rejuvenation. Falling asleep happens quickly, without any effort. Good. Now just drift and float, not thinking about anything in particular. Just let things come and go as things always do. Sleep is encompassing you now. The train is taking you along for the ride and to a new and beautiful destination when you rise. So enjoy this time, and allow my voice to completely fade away just as the sleepy train rolls along through the wilderness. Thank you and have a good night. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

Find a comfortable position that allows your spine to be long but with a natural curve in the low back. You can close your eyes or keep them open with a soft gaze downward a few feet in front of you. Let the belly and shoulders relax <break time='4s'/>. Today I'll guide you through a relieving stress practice. In this meditation, we'll practice cultivating a sense of ease, openness, and space even around difficult emotions. This practice can be an antidote for those times we feel stressed and overwhelmed. Before we start, take a full breath in <break time='4s'/> and a long breath out <break time='4s'/>. To begin this practice, invite your body to feel nourished and fed. As you breathe in you can imagine breathing in all the energy and positive emotion that your body needs <break time='4s'/>. As you breathe out, letting go of any tightness, tension, or toxicity <break time='4s'/>. Breathe in warmth and openness <break time='4s'/>. Breathe out tension or tightness <break time='4s'/>. Check in with the body, see if any tension has come up in the usual places. Soften them on the next exhale <break time='4s'/>. Feel free to move or shift your posture if that feels helpful. Check in now with the mind. Are there any stories taking up space that don't have to be there at this moment? <break time='4s'/>  Invite them to come and go. Neither clinging to them or pushing them away. Breathe in <break time='4s'/> and breathe out <break time='4s'/>. Now check in with the heart, are there sensations in the chest or the front of the body? <break time='4s'/> Notice any warmth, tightness, tension or openness that's there. Just observing and noting without judgement. Breathe in <break time='4s'/> and breathe out <break time='4s'/> and see if you feel more openness, ease, or spaciousness than when we started. As we begin to close this practice, you might invite a smile. You may want to bring your hand to your heart saying silently, may I be well, may I be happy. You can come back to this practice whenever you feel stressed or when you want to give yourself more nourishment or space. Lets finish this relieving stress practice now, by taking a full breath in <break time='4s'/> and a long breath out <break time='4s'/>. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

Then let that thought or feeling gently float away. Continue, breathing in  <break time='4s'/> and out <break time='4s'/>, and letting go of any thoughts as they come up. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

Meditation soothes anxiety by teaching us how to kindly distance ourselves from our thoughts. We don't have to believe everything we think. Practice letting go of thoughts with the following mindfulness exercise: Sit up tall in a quiet place where you can be free from distractions. Breathe slowly and evenly in and out through your nose. Let your energy settle by anchoring your attention to the breath. Soften your shoulders, belly and thighs. And watch the breath with a sense of loving awe. Breath in <break time='4s'/>, breath out <break time='4s'/>. Feel the gentle rise and fall of the body. As the body breathes itself. And let yourself drop into a state of being, rather than doing. Right here, right now, just present with the breath. And as you watch the breath, of course, thoughts will still arise. The mind is energy, and always at play. Today, as you notice these thoughts. Watch them as if from a distance. You are not your thoughts, but the witness of these thoughts. It can help to visualize your thoughts as if they are clouds or bubbles. A thought arises, it floats up and into our awareness, And then if left alone, it will also float on by, dissipate, or burst. Stay anchored to your breath as you play with awareness of this process. Present with breath. But aware of thought clouds, or thought bubbles that arise. Like clouds, like bubbles. Understand that these thoughts are not solid. Not fixed. They take shape, and they break apart. They are continuously changing shape, blown by the wind. They come and go. We cannot grasp at a cloud or a bubble. And neither is there any point in grasping to these thoughts. So let them be. Remain aware of the breath, as the thoughts do their thing. Avoid chasing, following or attaching to thought. Avoid trying to stop thoughts or push them away. Remain aware of the breath. Aware of this state of being, and not doing. Aware of thoughts, but not thinking. Breath in <break time='4s'/>, breath out <break time='4s'/>. Practice lovingly allowing your thoughts to shift, change and flow. Nothing to fight against, nothing to stop. Love your thoughts, and at the same time, let them go. Remain present, right here and right now. With your breath. Breath in <break time='4s'/>, breath out <break time='4s'/>. Recall that you are not your thoughts, but their witness. Look upon each thought with curiosity, or awe. But again and again, anchor back to the breath. Breath awareness, present with breath. The mind is energy, and energy is always at play. It up to you to choose which type of energy You'd like to invite in. And then simply let the rest go. Breathe in <break time='4s'/>, and breathe out <break time='4s'/>. Identifying with the energy of stability, Even breath. Steadiness, peacefulness, and ease. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

But giving the mind a job to do, such as watching the breath, you can trick the mind into settling down. Next time you find yourself occupied with anxiety, spend five minutes or more on breath awareness and teach your mind to slow down. Find a quiet place where you can be free from distractions and take a comfortable seat that promotes good posture. Set a timer for 5 minutes or longer, but choose a meditation length that will allow you to feel successful. Consistent meditation of just 5 minutes per day, is far better than one occasional 30 minute session. With your eyes opened or closed, breathe gently in <break time='4s'/> and out through your nose <break time='4s'/> and then as you sit here, watching the breath draw attention to your heart, and your desire to experience clam, peace and ease. Connect to this yearning inside of you and then silently, to yourself. Commit to remaining here, for the duration of your timer and commit to the practice of simply watching and noticing the breath and then having made that heartfelt commitment, return to your job, which is breath awareness. Perhaps settling in on the feeling of the breath as it moves in and out through your nose from the tip of the nose <break time='4s'/> to the space between your eyebrows <break time='4s'/>  or sensing the breath as it fills and expands your lungs then empties again <break time='4s'/> or aware of the breath as it moves all the way down into your belly <break time='4s'/> or spaciously sensing the overall rise and fall of the body with each breath in <break time='4s'/>, and each breath out <break time='4s'/>. Listen, for the ways in which the breath is speaking to you. Stay open, stay curious and remain free from any judgment or self criticism. The breath is perfect right now, just as it is. Your role, is simply to watch. Eventually, you'll notice the mind has wandered from breath awareness when this happens, spend no time wondering why spend no time asking where the mind has gone to spend no time on self blame simply turn the mind around, as quickly as you can and come back to your job of watching the breath. Go right back to that space in the body where you notice the breath most clearly returning perhaps to a sense of awe, wonder or amazement how precious is this one cycle of breath? <break time='4s'/> And again, if you find yourself distracted repeat this same process return to the breath do this as many times as you need to. Each time the mind wanders, turn the mind around without pausing to self criticize. Stay right here, present, aware, and honoring your intention this intention, this job, of watching the breath. With practice, you'll notice sooner when the mind has wandered with practice, you'll return to breath awareness more quickly with practice, you'll remain present with the breath for longer intervals between distractions. So continue to practice, until your timer has gone off and when your practice is complete, take a moment to recognize the goodness in the work you have done recognize the benefits of the effort you have made dedicate your efforts to your own healing, and to the healing of all beings, everywhere. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

Including your anxiety. It's possible that it will change for the better. To remember the grace that impermanence offers, try the following mindfulness exercise: Sit quietly in a safe place, with your posture tall, but your shoulders relaxed. If you feel safe closing your eyes, close them. Otherwise, keep your eyes open, but soften your gaze. Perhaps look down at the ground ahead of you. Maintain neutral posture in your back and neck. Breathe gently and slowly in <break time='4s'/> and out through your nose <break time='4s'/>. Allow your energy to settle by spending some time watching the breath. Let yourself be fully present with each slow, full breath in <break time='4s'/>. And each slow, full breath out <break time='4s'/>. Breathe in <break time='4s'/>. Breathe out <break time='4s'/>. And now think back to the earliest months of your life, when you were only a baby. Go as far back as you'd like to. Recall how different your body was then. How tiny you were, how fragile you were. Recall too, how little you understood of the world. There was a time when you could just barely recognize colors and shapes. A time when you could not feed yourself. A time when you could not stand or walk. A time when you didn't know how to read, or write. And then as you grew, and you began to make sense of the world. Recall the things you once believed that are no longer true. Perhaps you believed in fictional cartoon characters, or you held a particularly child like world view. But then it changed. There's very little of your body and your mind that's the same today as it was then. And yet, you are still you. Reflect back on the course of your life through later childhood and your early teenage years. Recall the physical changes you have gone through. Recall how much you have learned. And recall the changes to your world view. So much has changed in your body, so much has changed in your mind. And yet, you're still you. And so return to breath awareness now. Notice the continual movement of the breath. This constant flow. This constant exchange between breathing in <break time='4s'/> and breathing out <break time='4s'/>. Notice what's changing right here and right now. And the breath is a good place to start. There's never one single moment in which the breath remains the same. And in fact, if the breath were not in flow, you'd be in trouble. The inhale breath doesn't arrive toward the end and lament the oncoming exhale. The exhale breath doesn't begin to empty and worry over the incoming breath in. We let the inhale go. We let the exhale finish. We trust that this cycle of change will continue, giving us life. Contemplate the possibility that as change occurs in your breath, change is occurring right now in your body. Change is occurring right now in your mind. And possible that these incoming changes will give you life, give you peace, give you ease. Contemplate the possibility that your world view could shift. It could shift slowly, over time. And it could shift in an instant. Be open to this change. Aware that this change is full of potential. Remain watching the breath for as long as you'd like. And rest in the awareness that neither your body nor your mind are static, unchanging, or still. And let that be a very good thing. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

Make sure you are in a comfortable position, and you will not be disturbed for the duration of this session. Bring your focus to your breath, and really pay attention to how your lungs expand and contract when you inhale <break time='4s'/> and exhale <break time='4s'/>. Let your breath flow however it wants to right now. Notice your jaw <break time='4s'/>, and if you feel any tension here, just notice it, don't try to change anything. Now breathe into the sensations in your jaw <break time='4s'/>, and as you exhale, allow it to release a little <break time='4s'/>. Inhale again, imagine that you are breathing in new life <break time='4s'/>, and when you exhale, let all fear completely fade <break time='4s'/>. Take another breath in <break time='4s'/>, and when you exhale, feel yourself let go of any worries <break time='4s'/>. Notice how relaxed you are becoming right now. Let another breath come in naturally imagining a bright future <break time='4s'/>, and as you let it go, notice how depression eases and fades <break time='4s'/>. A gentle wave of relaxation sweeps over you as you breathe in <break time='4s'/> and out <break time='4s'/>. Allow your breath to flow naturally now, let yourself feel calm and peaceful. You deserve this wonderful feeling of serenity. You are open now to receive new thoughts, and you open up even more with each breath you take to new and fresh energy. Notice how new ideas begin to present themselves to you. Bring up feelings of abundance, as if you have so much that your cup pours over for others to enjoy the abundance you have created. Imagine that you are energized and have a zeal for life. Even if this is not true of your present self, imagine it vividly, and with as much detail as you can. See yourself full of energy and optimism. You can imagine it as if you are watching a movie of yourself if this helps, but see the colors brightly, and watch yourself full of ambition, taking steps towards achievement. Stay with your breath and allow your intentions to remain positive. Even if you don't feel positive in this moment, you can imagine what being joyful is like. So, breathe into this joy you are creating, and notice how you are consciously shifting any depressed or anxious thoughts right now, into peaceful feelings instead, by following your breath. Breathe deeply and let your exhale completely relax you. Any thoughts that previously held you back become smaller and smaller. Watch negative thoughts diminish, little by little, as if you are riding away in a car and these negative thoughts are sitting along the roadside, shrinking into the distance as you ride away with ease. As you see them go, you are freed from their grip. If you have any more negative thoughts rise, drop them off on the side of the road, by any creative means that arises, and ride away, watching them grow smaller until they are consumed by the horizon. Allow yourself a few moments to simply be. Notice and feel changes from this moment right now, and the difference between how you felt before you began this meditation. Your new thoughts find a new home within your inner being. Return your focus to your breath for a few moments <break time='4s'/>. In your own time, whenever you are ready, slowly open your eyes <break time='4s'/>. Good. Commend yourself for making these steps towards a better life. Accept this wonderful change to your new life. Take as much time as you'd like to just be in gratitude for several moments. Thank you. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

You want a short meditation practice for Reliefing Stress and Anxiety. Let me prepare the right practice for you.</speak>","weight": 0}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<speak> First, focus on breathing. Calm breathing is key to being calm and relaxed. Take a deep breath in through your nose <break time='4s'/>. Now exhale through your mouth, as if you are blowing out a candle <break time='4s'/>. Blow out all the air. As you inhale, focus on slowing down <break time='4s'/>. you are breathing into a calm rhythm. Exhale fully, releasing all the air <break time='4s'/>. Continue to breathe slowly and calmly. Now that you are getting the oxygen you need, realize that your only job right now is to keep yourself as comfortable as possible while this feeling passes. Fighting against the anxiety only makes it stronger, so right now, accept that you are feeling anxious. Let's focus on calming your thoughts to relieve anxiety.  Repeat the following phrases. I am feeling anxious right now, but I am okay. This feeling will pass, and no harm will come to me. I am safe, even though I feel frightened. I will soon be calm, even though I am experiencing anxiety right now. I will get through this. I am making myself as comfortable as possible while I wait for the anxiety to decrease. I can help myself to become gradually calmer and more relaxed until this feeling passes. Continue to give yourself calming messages. As you continue to breathe slowly in, <break time='4s'/> and exhale fully <break time='4s'/>, and as you continue to repeat calming thoughts, now we can address any shaking or trembling you are experiencing. When you experience anxiety, your body is in fight or flight mode. Your heart is pumping quickly so that oxygen can be delivered to your muscles to allow you to use those muscles to escape from danger. There is no real danger right now, so the adrenaline is flowing through your body but not being used. Your muscles are so ready for action that they are trembling. You can help this trembling to decrease by physically shaking out the tension. Imagine that you are shaking water off of your hands to dry them. Shake your hands <break time='4s'/>. Allow your hands and wrists to be limp as you shake your hands and forearms quickly back and forth <break time='4s'/>. Imagine drops of water flying off of your fingertips <break time='4s'/>. Imagine your tension draining out your fingertips and being shaken away <break time='4s'/>. Now stop and allow your hands to be still. Noticed how much more relaxed your hands feel? <break time='4s'/> They may even feel pleasantly tingly. Continue with even breathing and calm thoughts. Inhale, think I am becoming more and more calm <break time='4s'/>. Exhale and think I am feeling more and more relaxed <break time='4s'/>. Inhale, calm <break time='4s'/>. Exhale, relaxed <break time='4s'/>. The last area to focus on how to relieve anxiety is your tense muscles <break time='4s'/>. Your muscles become painful, tired, and cramped as a result of stress or anxiety. You can help your muscles relax now by first allowing your lower jaw to drop so your teeth are not touching . Let your jaw be relaxed and loose <break time='4s'/>. Now lower your shoulders. Let your shoulders be relaxed and loose <break time='4s'/>. You may even want to move your arms or shoulders in some circles, forward <break time='4s'/>, and back <break time='4s'/>, and now let your shoulders become limp as you increase the distance between your shoulders and your ears <break time='4s'/>. Raise your arms above your head and stretch <break time='4s'/>, and now release the muscles as you gently lower your arms to your sides <break time='4s'/>. Turn your head to the left <break time='4s'/>, back to the center <break time='4s'/>, and to the right <break time='4s'/>. Look down <break time='4s'/>, look straight ahead <break time='4s'/>, look up <break time='4s'/>. Bring your head to a relaxed and neutral position <break time='4s'/>. Straighten your back into the correct posture <break time='4s'/>. Keep your back upright but maintain the natural curves of your spine. <break time='4s'/> You can continue to move, stretch, and relax to allow your muscles to become less tense <break time='4s'/>. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

Get into a comfortable and relaxed position and just let go of all your daily stresses. Allow yourself to just be here and now, letting your body just be. You don't have to do anything because our bodies naturally want to be calm and relaxed. Sometimes thinking too much or being tense and being anxious doesn't allow for us to relax. So naturally, we must let go of any need to control the present moment and future outcomes. We feel anxious because we tend to overanalyze what we think will happen today, tomorrow or next week. We do this out of habit because in the past, situations and outcomes that didn't happen the way we expected, and we tend to feel that we need to be in control and be worried. In order to change this habit, we must change our self image and create new beliefs. That's what this session will teach you, but first, we need to get in a relaxed state and go within, calming our mind with some breathing. I will count down and with it number I say I want to fully inhale with your belly out and exhale tightening your belly. And with each breath, you will feel more and more relaxed, taking you into a deep state of peace. I will count down now. 5, take a full in breath <break time='4s'/> and as you exhale feel the tension loosen a little bit <break time='4s'/>. 4, take a nice deep breath in <break time='4s'/> and as you exhale you feel even more relaxed and tensions let go <break time='4s'/>. 3, full breath in <break time='4s'/> and out <break time='4s'/>. Your mind is becoming calm and clear. 2, inhale deeply <break time='4s'/> and when you exhale observe how the need to control subsides as you become extremely relaxed <break time='4s'/>. 1, as you take your last breath <break time='4s'/> and exhale slowly you feel any tension is gone, and you are in complete peace and tranquility <break time='4s'/>. Now you hear yourself saying I've survived this before, I'll survive now. I'm strong and I persevere through anything. I know that I'm not my anxiety. I can take things one step at a time. I live only in this moment. I approach this situation with openness and curiosity. I'm in charge of my breathing, and I can slow it down when I need to. I enjoy my feelings of inner calm. I'm actively taking steps to reduce my anxiety. I'm talented and have many things to offer. I cultivate patience to overcome anxiety. I'm courageous and can make it through everything. I use my unique strengths to move beyond anxiety. I know what I value and place my energy there. Life wants what is best for me. I am comfortable and connected with my environment. I can find pleasure in my life right now. I will only allow for healthy decisions in my life now. I am a strong, independent person. I am loved. I am unique. I am important. I matter therefore I am worthy. I can do this. I love who I am, I am in control. I control my mind it does not control me. I have the power to stop this. I succeed in what I do. I am relaxed, I am calm. I am successful. I am free from my anxiety. I am in control I am above the stress of any kind. All is well. I am safe. I am prepared for change. I am strong. I acknowledge when it is difficult and know I will rise above it. Good. Now I will count down from 5, and with each number, I say you will gain more and more awareness of the present moment, and as you do, you bring with you all that you gained today. You take action with a new mindset, ready to tackle any challenges without getting anxious or worried. 5, coming back slowly <break time='4s'/>. 4, feel how your body laying or sitting <break time='4s'/>. 3, you're becoming more alert <break time='4s'/>. 2, you're aware of your surroundings a bit more now <break time='4s'/>. 1, you feel fully awake and refreshed <break time='4s'/>.

Let me prepare the right practice for you.</speak>","weight": 0}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<speak> We're not always aware of our own anxiety. But the first step in feeling better, is to notice what we're feeling. Deepen awareness of body and mind by pausing for the following mindfulness exercise: With your eyes opened or closed, become aware of your breath. Often, the act of simply noticing changes the breath. But see if you can allow yourself to be present with the breath as it currently is. Without judgement, what do you notice about the quality of your breathing? <break time='4s'/> Notice if you're breathing through the mouth, or through the nose. Notice the breath is short, or long, shallow, or deep. Is there a difference between the length of the breath in, and the length of the breath out? <break time='4s'/> Allow breath to be just as it is. As you take a moment to list to yourself what it is that you find. At first, silently saying words to yourself like, short, shallow, gasping. Or rough, uneven, hurried. Over time, as you practice this meditation, you might drop the words and just feel. And then intentionally, purposefully, breathe in and out through your nose if you're not already. And take 3 full, relaxing, exhale breaths. One long breath in to prepare <break time='4s'/>, and then a long, full breath out <break time='4s'/>. Two more. Easy and patient breath in <break time='4s'/>, full and relaxed breath out <break time='4s'/>. Last one. Deep, slow breath in <break time='4s'/>, breathe all the way out <break time='4s'/>. Continue to breathe through your nostrils, steadily, and patiently. And now turn your attention to the body itself. Notice what's present in the body. Tightness? <break time='4s'/> Any pain? <break time='4s'/> Discomfort? <break time='4s'/> Are there areas of softness? <break time='4s'/> Spaciousness? <break time='4s'/> Joy? <break time='4s'/> Stay curious and open to sensation, free from self criticism. Allow whatever sensation you notice in the body to be here with you. And if a particular sensation, or area of the body is speaking to you. Let's go to it. Go to it with your attention and awareness. Ask what it's trying to say. Move towards this area with curiosity, with openness. Open to whatever it has to tell you. Be fully accepting of this sensation in this moment. And then silently describe to yourself what you're feeling. Perhaps this sensation has a temperature, a warmth or a coldness. Perhaps there's a color, a shape or a size. And if you feel nothing, notice that too. Take note. Whether you feel something or not, remain open to the possibility. That whatever you're feeling may change. You may even feel it changing right here, and right now. As you try to describe this sensation, as you observe it and attempt to give it form. Whether it's changing or not. Whether we notice sensation in the body or not. We have noticed something. And we've learned a little more about ourselves. So again, intentionally, purposefully, we'll take 3 full, relaxing, exhale breaths. One long breath in to prepare <break time='4s'/>, and then a long, full breath out <break time='4s'/>. Two more. Easy and patient breath in <break time='4s'/>, full and relaxed breath out <break time='4s'/>. Last one. Deep, slow breath in <break time='4s'/>, breathe all the way out <break time='4s'/>. Having checked in with body and breath, notice now your state of mind. What thoughts and emotions are present? <break time='4s'/>  And do you relate these thoughts and emotions to either the quality of your breath, or to the physical sensations in your body? <break time='4s'/> You may or may not. Notice, without judgment, if there are certain thought patterns at play in the mind. Continue to stay open and curious. Allow for whatever is present. Welcome it in, and ask what it's trying to teach you. This exercise here is not about self criticism or self blame. The exercise here is to simply notice. To acknowledge anxiety, or anything else that's present. To allow it to be present. And to give it space. To give it the space to move and change. Often, our breath, our body, our minds. Know far more than we do about what will bring calm. In their own way, they are each trying to teach us. Always, about how to find freedom and joy. So ask what the breath, the body and mind are trying to tell you. And then listen. Listen with an open curiosity, listen without expectation. Listen with love in your heart. For the breath, body and mind are not the enemy. But the tools through which we're given the clues that will guide us home. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

Sometimes, focused and kind attention is all we need to feel more peaceful and at ease. To ease your anxiety by opening your heart, try the following mindfulness exercise: Sit tall, but relaxed, in a quiet and safe place. Breathe patiently and evenly in and out through your nose. Count out three, slow and perfect breaths. One long, full breath in <break time='4s'/>, and one long, full breath out <break time='4s'/>. Again with a full, slow breath in <break time='4s'/>, and a full, slow breath out <break time='4s'/>. One more time, breathe in <break time='4s'/> and then empty with breath out <break time='4s'/>. And now let your breathing relax, but find a nice balance between letting go of controlled breath all together, and still aware of, and extending the length of the exhale breath a tiny bit. Take note of how you're feeling right now in your body, heart and mind <break time='4s'/>. Ask yourself, what's present in the body? <break time='4s'/> Maybe you notice physical sensation, discomfort, ease, what's here? <break time='4s'/> And then from an overall sense of the body, check in with the heart space <break time='4s'/>. Are there any emotions present? <break time='4s'/> And then what about what's going on in the mind? <break time='4s'/> Are there any stories present, positive or negative, that you may relate? <break time='4s'/> To this felt sensation, or to these emotions. Notice what's here without self criticism, without self judgment. In fact, notice what's here with an open heart, a loving kindness, a sense of compassion. To help us tap into that sense of compassion, we'll repeat to ourselves a few phrases. The first is: these feelings are not mine alone to carry <break time='4s'/>, secondly: there are many others who feel the same way I do <break time='4s'/>. Third: I accept these feelings, thoughts and emotions as a shared human experience <break time='4s'/>. And as you say these phrases, notice again if there's any reaction in body, heart or mind. Be kind to yourself. Accept how you are feeling. And extend yourself compassion. Next, bring to mind a loved one, someone whom you know personally, someone who is very dear to you. And visualize them sitting across from you. Right here and right now. Take note of this loved one in all their complexity. Recognize they too, feel anxiety, difficulty, or pain. They too, have good and bad days. And they too have struggles which you may or may not know anything about. See if you can feel, in your own body, heart and mind what your loved one might be feeling. And then intentionally send them the following phrases. What my loved one is feeling is not theirs alone to carry, there are many others who feel the same way they do. May they accept these feelings, thoughts and emotions as a shared human experience. And then from your heart to theirs, send them kindness. Send them acceptance. Send them compassion. See them having received your wish. See the ease and the joy that arises as they begin to understand they're not alone. Next, repeat the same exercise with an acquaintance, a challenging person, or with all beings in the world. Sit them directly across from you, and see them in all their complex humanity. See their good and bad days, see their joys and their hardships. See their moments of total suffering, even those that they hide. And then with love and kindness in your heart, send them the following phrases...What this person/these people is/are feeling is not theirs alone to carry, there are many others who feel the same way they do. May they accept these feelings, thoughts and emotions as a shared human experience. And then from your heart to theirs, send them kindness. Send them acceptance. Send them compassion. See them having received your wish. See the ease and the joy that arises as they begin to understand they're not alone. And recall too, that you are not alone. That you are able to recognize joy and pain equally in others because you have had the experience of joy and pain yourself. And then check in with how you are feeling now in body, heart and mind. As you fill up with the recognition that you've sent loving kindness to so many others. Perhaps you're better able to connect with the sensation of having received loving kindness yourself. That which we give, we get back in return. So continue, to practice kindness, acceptance and compassion every moment of each day. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

The more you practice, the more easily you will relax under pressure. This exercise will review three ways to relax under pressure, including calm breathing, relaxing tense muscles, and calming your thoughts. Start by concentrating on your breathing. Breathe in <break time='4s'/> and out <break time='4s'/>. Deeply in <break time='4s'/>, and slowly out <break time='4s'/>. In <break time='4s'/> and out <break time='4s'/>. Keep breathing slowly like this. You can slow your breathing even further by counting. Breathe in to the count of four <break time='4s'/> hold to the count of three <break time='4s'/> and breathe out to the count of five <break time='4s'/>. Breathe in <break time='4s'/>,  hold <break time='4s'/>, exhale <break time='4s'/>. Breathe in <break time='4s'/>, hold <break time='4s'/>, breathe out <break time='4s'/>. Breathe in <break time='4s'/> and out <break time='4s'/>. Keep breathing letting your breath slow comfortably. You are learning the relaxation skill of slowing your breathing. You can actually feel yourself calming down as you breathe slowly and calmly. This calm breathing helps you focus and be alert and relaxed. You are learning how to relax under pressure. Continue to breathe slowly and every so often just notice your breathing and focus on allowing your breathing to slow down. Now concentrate on your muscles <break time='4s'/>. You may find that you are holding tension in your muscles. Pay particular attention to your shoulders <break time='4s'/>, hands <break time='4s'/>, and jaw <break time='4s'/>. Consciously lower your shoulders <break time='4s'/>. Let your shoulders relax and allow the muscles to loosen. This act of relaxing your shoulders allows you to become calm because it places your body in a relaxed easy position instead of a tense one. Notice your hands and let your hands be open, loose, and relaxed <break time='4s'/>. Let your arms rest by your sides letting go of all tension and just relaxing <break time='4s'/>. You are learning how to relax under pressure. Focus on your jaw <break time='4s'/>. Allow your jaw to rest loosely so your teeth are not touching <break time='4s'/>. Let your mouth be loose and relaxed <break time='4s'/>. Mentally scan your body now noticing any areas that are tense. When you notice tension concentrate on relaxing that area. Allow your muscles to give up the tension they have been holding. Allow your body to relax. You are learning how to relax under pressure. Focus on your breathing again noticing relaxing. Count each breath again if you like, breathing in to the count of four <break time='4s'/>, holding for a count of three <break time='4s'/>, and breathing out to the count of five <break time='4s'/>. Now concentrate on your thoughts. Imagine each affirmation that follow and believe each one to be true. You may want to repeat each phrase silently in your mind. You are learning how to relax under pressure. I am calm. I am relaxed. I know how to relax easily. I relax whenever I want to. I handle situations with ease. I am prepared. I am focused. I am strong. I am confident. I am so deeply relaxed. I am so calm and serene. I concentrate easily on the task at hand. I easily relax under pressure. I easily relax under pressure. I feel calm and relax under pressure. I am capable. I am intelligent.  I am worthwhile. I am skilled. I am relaxed. I am relaxed. Every time you are under pressure remember to do the three relaxation techniques you have just practiced: Calm breathing. Relax your muscles. Calm your thoughts. You can relax any time you need to, and the relaxation will help you to concentrate and keep your brain functioning at its best. The slightest feeling of nervousness causes you to relax. You can relax every day in every situation. Go through the relaxation exercises as many times as you need to in preparation for high pressure situations. When you relax, these situations can feel much less stressful. Breathe deeply <break time='4s'/>. Relax your muscles. Calm your thoughts. Breathe deeply <break time='4s'/>. Relax your muscles. Calm your thoughts.  Now you have completed this relaxation exercise. You can relax again any time you need to and will experience the most benefit if you practice relaxing every day. For now, it's time to return to the day ahead. Slowly reawaken your mind and body, becoming alert and awake while remaining relaxed and calm. Open your eyes and look around. Stretch if you want to. Sit quietly for a few moments as you wake up completely. When you are fully alert you can resume your usual activities feeling calm and refreshed. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

Get into a nice position where you can be upright, elongating the spine. It is best to be seated in the traditional meditation position with legs crossed, but if you need to have your back supported, you may sit in a chair. Gaze around with your eyes, taking note of your surroundings. See the colors clearly. Notice things that are completely still around you, like the ground, furniture, and structures. Can you become aware of anything around you that has movement? <break time='4s'/> Look around without putting labels on the things you see, just observe their colors, textures, and patterns. Notice how far away things are from you, or how close they are. See how the light lays upon things, illuminating them. Allow your mind to naturally find a spot in front of you to fixate on. Begin to slowly blink your eyes, and do not look away. Feel the relaxation within the darkness each time you blink. Repeat this until your eyes want to naturally close. When you close your eyes, notice a gentle wave of relaxation sweep over your entire body. Bring your awareness to your breath, what is it like? <break time='4s'/> Did you take a nice inhale as soon as you focused on your breathing? <break time='4s'/> Pay close attention to how your lungs expand and contract with your breath. It is a very natural and gentle sensation. Notice how your belly also expands and contracts easily as you breathe. Allow the breath to relax you. In <break time='4s'/> and out <break time='4s'/>. Expand <break time='4s'/> and contract <break time='4s'/>. Refresh <break time='4s'/> and relax <break time='4s'/>. Inhale <break time='4s'/> and exhale <break time='4s'/>. Take a deep breath and hold it for 5 seconds …exhale and relax….take another deep breath, as deep as you can, and hold it…count for 5 seconds <break time='4s'/>, and as you exhale just imagine blowing out all of your stress <break time='4s'/>. Take a third deep breath and hold it <break time='4s'/>, and as you exhale you blow out all stress you've been holding on to, saying to yourself relax now <break time='4s'/>. This is your new solution to stress. Whenever you feel burdened in the future, you simply take 3 fully in and deep breaths, holding it at the top of the inhalation for 5 seconds, and when you exhale, blow out any tension or strain that you have been holding on to. And on the last breath as you exhale, you simply say to yourself, relax now. From now on you choose to be relaxed. You choose to be calm. You choose to be in control of all you do, because your health is very important to you. Remember that it is natural for you to be healthy and happy. It is unnatural for you to have sickness and misery. Now hear yourself saying, Each day, in every way, I get better and better. Breathe in and out. In order to make change, I challenge myself. Expand and contract. Change is not comfortable, in fact it is inconvenient, so if I feel comfortable with the change I am making, I am probably not extending myself enough. Refresh and relax. Each day, in every way, I get better and better. Inhale and exhale. Whenever I am presented with feelings of stress, I know my breath is there to soothe me and guide me into relaxation. In and out. Every single day, I become more aware of all the good things going on in my community, and in the world around me. In <break time='4s'/>and out <break time='4s'/>. When I feel that darkness is surrounding me, I know that the way to see light is to take 3 deep breaths, relaxing my mind and body by doing so. Inhale <break time='4s'/> and exhale <break time='4s'/>. In order to make great change, I challenge my thoughts. From now on I challenge every single negative and unproductive thought as they arise. Good. From this point forward, whenever you find yourself having negative and unproductive thoughts, you immediately say to yourself the word STOP. Let me repeat that to you so that it is perfectly clear. Whenever you find yourself having negative and unproductive thoughts, you immediately say to yourself the word STOP, and the very moment you say the word STOP you'll find that the negative thoughts you were having simply disappear. This gives you the opportunity to start a new and positive thought process. Once again, hear yourself say this positive affirmation, When I have a negative thought, I acknowledge that I feel this way and then I release it. When another negative thought arises, I catch it quickly and I say with confidence, I acknowledge that part of me feels this way, but this thought does not help me right now. Good. You are doing very powerful work. This is the way you change your life for the better. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

Lie down in a comfortable, quiet place where you can be free from distractions. If you're supporting your head or chest, maintain a neutral neck and spine. Close your eyes, to help turn your attention inward. Breathe gently and quietly in <break time='4s'/> and out through your nose <break time='4s'/>. Count out 5 slow cycles of breath <break time='20s'/>. Let your whole body rest back. Drop into the awareness that this is your time to be at ease, and to be still. Let yourself be present here. There's nowhere else you need to be, and nothing else you need to do. That's more important than resting, right here, and right now. We'll begin with awareness of the head and face <break time='4s'/>. Without moving too much, shut your eyes tight <break time='4s'/>, scrunch up your nose <break time='4s'/>, and pucker your lips <break time='4s'/>. Squeeze tight every muscle of your face <break time='4s'/>, your brow <break time='4s'/>, your entire head <break time='4s'/>. Hold this tension as tightly as you can for a long patient inhale breath <break time='4s'/>. Then with exhale, let go <break time='4s'/>. Pay particular attention to the sensation of this release. Notice sensation in the muscles of the face. Notice the process of movement from tight, to soft. Notice the feeling, of the face and head expanding into relaxation. Be present with this feeling of letting go for as long as you'd like to. As we move through this meditation, you can pause at any time. When you're ready, drop your awareness to your shoulders <break time='4s'/>. The sides of your rib cage <break time='4s'/>. Your chest and your back <break time='4s'/>. Your belly and low back <break time='4s'/>. Aware of your entire torso <break time='4s'/>. And then as you lie here, with inhale breath, squeeze and flex this torso <break time='4s'/>. Squeeze the sides of your body, tighten your belly <break time='4s'/>. Activate your back <break time='4s'/>, your shoulders <break time='4s'/>, your chest <break time='4s'/>. Hold tight as you seek out activation in every last little corner of the torso <break time='4s'/>. Hold tight as you take a long inhale <break time='4s'/>. And then with exhale breath, let go <break time='4s'/>. As you let go, stay present with this process. The physical sensation of the muscles releasing. And a felt sensation of softening. Not only in the body, but also in the mind. Notice, how as space slowly unfolds in the body. More space is available in the breath, and in the mind. Let this process of relaxing continue. As you watch, listen, sense, feel, notice. And then as you're ready, bring awareness to your arms <break time='4s'/>. Upper and lower arms <break time='4s'/>, wrists <break time='4s'/>, hands and fingers <break time='4s'/>. Notice what's present right now. With an inhale breath, make fists with your hands <break time='4s'/>. Squeeze in your fingers <break time='4s'/>. Activate your forearms <break time='4s'/>. Maybe bend your elbows and curl your wrists toward your shoulders <break time='4s'/>. Recruit every muscle of the arms and the hands. Every single one. Hold tight as you take one more patient inhale <break time='4s'/>. And with exhale breath, release <break time='4s'/>. Let your arms lay flat by your side <break time='4s'/>. Face your palms up <break time='4s'/>. And feel each one of your fingers slowly letting go <break time='4s'/>. Notice where in the arms you feel this opening. And invite awareness of opening into your whole being. Bring your awareness now to your hips <break time='4s'/>, your buttocks <break time='4s'/>, your thighs <break time='4s'/>. Notice the presence of sensation in this area, or perhaps none. And then with inhale breath, activate the thighs, the buttocks, perhaps the low belly <break time='4s'/>. Squeeze, tighten, engage every single muscle of this area. Hold and squeeze for that long inhale breath <break time='4s'/>. And then with exhale, soften <break time='4s'/>. Watch the process of softening. Stay present with the sensation of letting go. Notice the softening in your upper legs <break time='4s'/>, your backside <break time='4s'/>, your low belly <break time='4s'/>. Notice also, the softening in your mind <break time='4s'/>. Grateful for the sensation of tension. That helps us better recognize the sensation of letting go. Now bring your awareness to your knees <break time='4s'/>, your lower legs <break time='4s'/>, your ankles <break time='4s'/>, feet and toes <break time='4s'/>. With an inhale breath, curl your toes in, flex or scrunch your feet, squeeze your knees, your calf and shin muscles <break time='4s'/>. Hold this tension intentionally for another inhale breath <break time='4s'/>. Then with your exhale, let go <break time='4s'/>. Feel the tension exiting. Is it exiting the body, or exiting the mind? <break time='4s'/> Both? <break time='4s'/> Watch and follow this process until there's no longer any resistance to notice. Watch and follow the process until the body is completely at ease. Stay present with ease in the body. Notice how this ease lives also in the breath, and in the mind. Enjoy resting here in this state, for as long as you'd like to. When you're ready to carry along with your day, carry too, this awareness of peace. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

You want a long meditation practice for Reliefing Stress and Anxiety. Let me prepare the right practice for you.</speak>","weight": 0}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<speak> Hello and welcome to this session focusing on when we have low amounts of stress. We all get stressed daily but sometimes we aren't even aware that we are stressed. Stress doesn't have to be a thought or even a reaction. it could be sitting somewhere in your body, lingering as long as you are unaware of it. Think about a time when you were worried. did this worry also make you feel drained or tired? <break time='4s'/> That's because every time we are worried we have a low level of stress present, and what causes stress is not worry but our reaction to worry. Did you know that each human has about 50,000 thoughts a day? <break time='4s'/> If we believed all of these thoughts, we would surely get ourselves into trouble. So, instead, realize that thoughts simply come and go. That our thoughts are not truly who we are. When we take a step back from all these thoughts, we can observe them better and see them for what they are. just passing moments of thinking. Attaching too much emotion to one stressful thought can disrupt our day, and our entire lives. Let's step away now from our thoughts and worries by just becoming aware of our body. Feel how the air around you hugs to the shape of your body. Notice how you can willingly activate all of your senses, hear all the sounds around you. Hear your own breath. When you breathe a little bit deeper, can you smell anything? <break time='4s'/> You can even imagine you smell something, and your mind can create the thought of it for you. Imagine the smell of vanilla. Can you remember how it smells? <break time='4s'/> Good. Now notice your fingertips and feel what are touching and feeling right now <break time='4s'/>. And become aware of your feet <break time='4s'/>. Notice how the soles of your feet feel right now. Good. And just become aware of your entire body right now <break time='4s'/>. Feeling different areas. Becoming aware of your body through focusing takes you out of your thoughts, so use this technique when worry, or light stress rises in your mind. We react to worry because we believe that the worry is real. Did you know that ninety five percent or more of our worries don't even end up happening? <break time='4s'/> We think of worry as bad but actually worries are a very important part of our lives. Without worry you could make bad decisions. Without worry we would walk off a cliff without taking precaution. Our brain creates worry to keep us on guard and alert, but some of us let worries carry us away allowing them to take over, putting stress in full control of our mind and body. Instead of letting doubts push us around and drain us, we can learn to use the worry to our advantage. Uneasiness can either become our greatest strength or our biggest weakness. So let's gain control over our fears that cause stress. Instead of reacting to it we will learn and become stronger from each time it arises. To do this, we need to identify where this emotion is located and then bring awareness to it whenever it arises, purposefully creating space between it. Make sure you are sitting or lying down in a comfortable position. Your legs can be crossed or uncrossed, but make sure your spine straight <break time='4s'/>. You can keep your eyes closed or open. If you keep your eyes open just look at one spot, fixing your gaze on just that one point without looking anywhere else. Take a few deep breaths to relax even more <break time='4s'/>. Bring into your mind a good emotion, like excitement. Noticing in your body where you feel changes happening, kind of like mapping it. Remember a time when you were really excited about something. Could be anything, no matter how small or big. Just vividly remember how it felt, where you felt it in your body, and how did you move? <break time='4s'/> What changes do you notice? <break time='4s'/> Find out where exactly this feeling of excitement is located. Is it in your stomach? <break time='4s'/> Or in your chest? <break time='4s'/> Maybe it moves around and doesn't stay in one place. Get familiar with this feeling. You can change the way you are feeling in your body at any time, by remembering an experience of excitement or joy. Your body creates the feeling as if it's happening right now. Good. Use this knowledge of how excitement makes your body feel and how easy it is to bring it back upon will. Now we are going to create a worrisome feeling consciously, no need to be afraid or to avoid this feeling. It's a natural human emotion that just happens. Avoiding it is what creates discomfort and additional stress. So remember a time when you felt worried, some moment in life when stress took full control of you and locate this emotion. Where do you feel it? <break time='4s'/> Just sit with it for a moment. Right now you are in complete control. Being aware of this feeling right now is what creates the space that you need. Just see this emotion as it is, a simple sensation in your body that has no power. It lingers sometimes in one place or moves around. Now with this feeling of stress, bring back that feeling of excitement. Notice how well we can change the way we feel when we focus on different feelings. As vividly as possible bring that feeling of excitement into your body. Remember when you were absolutely full of thrill that little mattered to you except for this joy. Remember how it made you so excited that you couldn't stay still, and this strong energy was flowing all through your body. Now notice all the different sensations in your body. Notice any changes happening, put your awareness within you to see exactly what's happening. Good. You probably forgot about stress and feel no trace of that worry sensation, or maybe can still feel it, but you notice that it's just there. It might even feel a little pleasant or strange, but it's not in control of you. See it for what it is   an emotion that's here to protect and care about you. You can see that there is no need to escape it. No need to get stressed about it. This is the SPACE of peace. Keep practicing this space, at all times during your day, especially when you are really worried. Just remember a time of happiness, or passion or any other positive emotion, and let it rise in your body. Stress can leave as easily as it comes. It could stay for a short time, or it could stay for a long time. It is up to you, and how you react to it. So anytime you are faced with worries, remember these techniques, and implement them so that you can go about your day without the burden of stress. You are doing amazing work, well done. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

You want a long meditation practice for Reliefing Stress and Anxiety. Let me prepare the right practice for you.</speak>","weight": 0}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<speak> This meditation is presented by my piece of mindfulness, please enjoy this session in a secluded, peaceful location, giving yourself the relaxation you deserve. Welcome to this relaxing session to clear anxiety. I'm honored to guide you today, to let go and feel amazing. Before you begin listening, get into a very comfortable position so that you can deeply relax. Fully lay down and allow your head to be supported. Make any adjustments to feel more comfortable and more relaxed. Just follow along with my words without trying too hard, allowing me to guide you deep down into the subconscious mind, where you are ultimately in charge of making all the changes you need to feel your best. Deep within our subconscious mind, we could have trapped old feelings. Sometimes these feelings are positive, and sometimes they are negative. The way the hypnosis works is it allows you to relax deeply to access your subconscious mind so that you can access the negative feelings safely and effortlessly. Feeling relaxed and calm with every word I say, you will get more and more deeply relaxed. Feel yourself melting into more relaxation, going down into a nice relaxed state of mind, and the more relaxed you get, the more you will find the things deep inside your mind that are not helpful to you. You're going to find them and make them known by honoring them. Now I will count from one to five, and you will breathe with each number I say. One, breathe in and out. <break time='4s'/> Two, breathing in and breathing out, relaxing. <break time='4s'/> Three, breathe in and breathe out, even deeper down into a nice state of mind. <break time='4s'/> Four, don't force the breath, just allow the breath to come in exactly how it needs to. <break time='4s'/> Five, very relaxed, breathing. <break time='4s'/> Your breathing never stops, so you can always tune into it, and it allows you to relax. No need to think, no need to worry about your thoughts, just relaxing. Allow for your thoughts to just drift through your mind, one after the other. You're not really concerned with these thoughts, allow for the relaxation to multiply. Now imagine that in front of you, there is a little hill going down a grass hill, and you will walk down this hill, and I will count down from ten. With each number I say, allow yourself to drift even more, feel yourself walking down the hill. Nine, relaxing. <break time='4s'/> Eight. <break time='4s'/> Seven, letting go right now. <break time='4s'/> Six, breathing in deeply. <break time='4s'/> Five, going very deep now. <break time='4s'/> Let it happen, it feels good. Follow along with my voice. Three, <break time='4s'/> two, <break time='4s'/> and one, <break time='4s'/> the subconscious mind is fully present. You have made it down the hill, you have let go of your conscious mind, the mind that judges whether something is right or wrong. It doesn't matter here, deep within your subconscious mind, feeling so good and letting go even more. Just let go of anything, anything that's left. Allow for the subconscious mind to listen carefully to these wonderful words. Anxiety is a choice. You have a choice whether you want to be anxious or not, everything in life is a choice. Did you know that you can only think one thing at a time? It is impossible for the human mind to think of two thoughts at the same time. So, when you have an anxious thought, immediately replace it with a positive one. It could be related or unrelated, either way, choose a positive thought, and you will notice as you practice this technique, you will become good at training your mind to think how you want it to think. Now allow yourself to go even deeper into comfort, letting your body feel heavy, and imagine you're walking along a sandy beach. Your feet are bare in the sand. This beach represents your subconscious mind, and here you will understand what makes it difficult for you to move forward past anxiety. As you walk along the beach, you allow yourself to let go of those unwanted things deep within your subconscious mind. Those things in your past are coming through and being freed, walking through the beach, allowing anything in your subconscious mind that needs to be let go of to surface and release. Feel the warm sand under your feet, comfortable and soft. Know that you can choose to let go of anything you want that is deep within your subconscious mind. As you walk, you let go with each footprint. Breathe in deeply again, <break time='4s'/> the power of choice as you count to three, one, two, three, and breathe out, <break time='4s'/> count down from three, three, two, one, letting go of these old stuck feelings, cleansing your subconscious mind with each breath you take. Breathe in, one, two, three, <break time='4s'/> breathe out, three, two, one. <break time='4s'/> Notice how easy it is to walk across the beach through the sand. You are feeling happy and positive, knowing that your choice between the positive and negative is more clear because you have accessed your subconscious mind, and you have now made the choice to think what you want to think, from this moment forward, today and in the future. You are happy and relaxed. Before, you were anxious because you didn't take care of these subconscious memories, but now you've let them go, you've allowed things to sort themselves out. From here forward, you will be most calm and most relaxed, allow for things in your life to sort themselves out, knowing that things always turn out how they should be. You will be granted a calmness, you will be very happy and relaxed. Now say to yourself, I am proud of you. I am a good person who truly cares. I just care about myself and about others. I want for there to be a better tomorrow. I relax when I feel anxious feelings. I can relax deeply and let go by following along with my breath. I am strong and I am calm in all situations. Feel yourself drifting and floating into a deeper relaxation. My voice is an anchor, holding down the world for you. Feel yourself becoming healed of any anxiety, this moment as you drift even further into a nice calm state of mind. You deserve this, it's okay. All the weight and tension slide away from your body, and your emotions become clear and defined. You know how to feel your emotions, and you know how to move through them. In a moment, I will say the word sleep and you will allow all anxieties you've ever had to melt away completely. I will count to three before I say the word, and then simply let it go. One, two, three, sleep, and allow. Very good, you are so relaxed. You are beautiful, you are amazing, and the world deserves to hear what you have to say. You now have confidence through life, and you allow anxieties to melt through you, let them come and let them go. You now have the choice whether you stick with the negative or flow with the positive. Whenever you are ready, open your eyes and feel a new calm body to take on life with. Good job today. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

Let me prepare the right practice for you.</speak>","weight": 0}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<speak> Hello, thank you for joining me today. Our current culture is fast paced and frequently very demanding, not allowing for very much downtime to recover. It's not surprising that many of us have experienced stress, overwhelm, and anxiety at some point in our lives. These feelings are often caused by the racing and overactive thoughts of our mind. Meditation is a wonderful tool to help quiet the busy mind in the moment and also to practice being able to balance and center our emotions for future situations. You have already taken the most difficult step to helping yourself; you have chosen to take time to practice this guided meditation. Let's begin. Find a posture of comfort. Sit or lie down so you can experience ease in your body, which will allow for ease in your mind. We will start this meditation with your eyes open. Gently focus your line of vision on one point in front of you. You can find a spot on the floor or the wall. And now narrow your focus to this one single point and allow everything in the background to blur or fade away. See all that you can see about this one single point. Now slowly broaden your field of view like a camera lens widening. With a relaxed awareness, notice everything you can see in your current much broader line of view without having to turn your head. What colors, textures, and materials do you see? Do you see brightness or dim light around you? Take it all in. Once more, slowly narrow your field of view to the same single point. As your focus narrows, continue to draw it in until your eyes gradually close, and you invite your attention to turn inward. And now start to notice the natural rhythm and depth of your breath. Without making any changes, just notice. Listen to the sound of your breath. Look for any movement of your body that is connected to your breath. And now intentionally begin to deepen each breath in and slow down on your exhale. As you slow down and deepen your breath, take time to notice all there is to experience about your breath and explore how your breath might change slightly as you continue to look inward. Simply notice the experience of your breath without expectations and without judgments. What would it be like to offer your breath some love and compassion? Like your breath slowing down, your mind too can slow down in relationship to each breath. As your breath and your mind slow, notice the space between each breath and the similar space or pause between your thoughts. Invite this gap between breaths and thoughts to lengthen. Be in the gap. No need to do anything; simply be in this space without expectations. What do you notice in stillness? This is a judgment free practice of allowing what is there to come to the surface with curiosity. If you find your mind wandering or your sense of calm beginning to dissipate, come back to your breath and the gap between thoughts. When we slow down, we notice more. When we are in the gap, we notice what we might otherwise be missing when we rush or overthink. Experience your body being breathed, and let your attention rest on the space between breath and thought. Now broaden your awareness to the physical experience of your body. Look inside and sense the energy and feelings of one single point at the area of your stomach. What do you notice at this one small focal point? Similar to broadening your visual focal point, begin to widen the experience of your sensations moving outward from your stomach. Notice where your body makes a connection with the surface below you. Perhaps you sense there is a blurring of the lines that separate you from the support and from the energy around you, or maybe you feel pressure or warmth at this connection. Continue gradually moving this relaxed scan of your body out from your center. Notice if there are any parts that are making contact with another part of your body. Awaken to the sensations in your body moving out from your center. Now sense the aliveness in your hands and in your feet. Feel the energy moving within you. Inhabit your body fully. When we can do this, live in this body, sense our own aliveness, we are in the present and living in the space between our thoughts. When your mind is attentive to the sensations of your body, you can pause. You can extend the gap between your thoughts. This gap is where you can experience peace and calm. Notice now if there is anywhere you can soften a little bit more. Look for anywhere you can let go even deeper into relaxation and ease. Let your physical body go so that you can let your thoughts go. Imagine your thoughts are like a river flowing gently downstream. Let your thoughts go so you can be here now, awake to the sensations in your body. What would it be like to relax a tense muscle right now? What would it feel like to let go of tension and tightness? Look inside for any areas of your body that are telling you something. Sometimes the simple act of attending to a sensation allows it to soften or fade away. Our body wants to be heard, to be recognized. Invite your attention to move to the areas of your body that are telling you something and feel the sensations there. Quiet your thoughts to hear the sensations. If you find your mind drifting, going back to old patterns of thinking or overthinking, lovingly come back. Gesture your attention to come back to the sensations once more. Stay with the experience of your sensations as they arise for a moment longer, knowing that you can always come back to this state of quiet because it has always been a part of you. Take another full breath in and let it out as slowly as you can, and do this again, letting go of your breath, letting go of tension, letting go of your busy mind. As you broaden your field of awareness once more, look for habits or recurring tendencies that you may have to leave your body and come back as many times as you need. Start over with your aware presence. In life outside of meditation, look for patterns when you might be rushing, and come back to experience life fully. When we slow down and stay with the sensations as long as we can, we notice more. We live more fully. When we are trying to control our life to make it just the way we want it to be perfect, we are not experiencing all that life has to offer. Listen to what wants to be heard. See what wants to be seen. To do this, slow down. Pause in the gap between thoughts. Quiet our thoughts to see, hear, and feel deeply. Inhabit your body fully and be open to life. When you are ready, open your eyes. I hope you have a peaceful and calm day. Thank you for practicing with me.</speak>]","weight": 1}]}

Take a third deep breath and hold it <break time='4s'/> and as you exhale you blow out any stress you've been holding on to, saying to yourself relax now <break time='4s'/>.  This is your new solution to stress. Whenever you become stressed in the future, you simply take three fully in and deep breaths, holding it at the top of the inhalation for 5 seconds, and when you exhale, blow out any stress that you feel. And on the third breath as you exhale you simply say to yourself, relax now. Begin by slowly blinking your eyes, and with each number I say, blink once. Ten <break time='4s'/>,  nine <break time='4s'/>,  eight <break time='4s'/>,  seven <break time='4s'/>,  six <break time='4s'/>,  five <break time='4s'/>, four <break time='4s'/>, three <break time='4s'/>,  two <break time='4s'/>  one <break time='4s'/>  and zero <break time='4s'/>. Allow your eyes to gently close, and when you do this, you feel a wave of relaxation sweep over you. Now I'd like for you to focus on the sensations at the top of your head <break time='4s'/>. Just notice how the very top of your head feels. And now let your focus move down to your eyes <break time='4s'/>. Just notice how your eyes feel and ask them to relax even more. The little movement in your eyes is called rapid eye movement and is completely normal.  These small eye movements allow for you to feel calm. Notice how the back of your head feels against the surface that it is touching. How heavy does your head feel right now? <break time='4s'/> Let your focus move to your nose, and feel the slight sensations of the air moving in and out with your breath <break time='4s'/>. When you breathe in, imagine that you are being filled with calmness <break time='4s'/>, and when you breathe out, imagine your body feels heavy and deeply relaxed <break time='4s'/>. Very good. Now focus on your ears <break time='4s'/>. Notice how they feel, and what they hear around you. Try to hear every single noise. When sounds come into your ears they act as little waves of relaxation taking you even deeper. Notice the sound of my voice and how soothing and motherly it is. From here forward you can only hear my voice guiding you. All other sounds passing though only take you deeper into a state of relaxation. Now focus on your mouth, how does it feel? <break time='4s'/> And what do you notice? <break time='4s'/> Can you sense the flavor of something you recently tasted? <break time='4s'/> Perhaps you can imagine biting into a fresh slice of lemon, and you notice how your mouth waters. Very good. And move your focus down now to your neck, and if there is any tension just ask it to release a little more <break time='4s'/>. Notice how your neck feels right now, and just feel all of the sensations in your neck. Now focus on your shoulders and move your attention slowly going down each arm<break time='4s'/>, down all the way to each fingertip <break time='4s'/>. What are your fingertips touching right now? <break time='4s'/> Feel the sensations on your fingertips. Nice. Allow your focus to go to your chest <break time='4s'/>, relaxing this area, as well as your upper back <break time='4s'/>. And if you notice any tension, just ask it nicely to release just a little. Now imagine you are focusing on your heart <break time='4s'/>, and feeling it beating strongly, supporting you. Relax your heart and notice how good it feels to do so. And now focus on your lungs <break time='4s'/>. Feel them gently expanding and contracting with your breath, delivering oxygen to your body. Allow your focus to move down your vital organs and digestive system. Just notice your belly and how it feels <break time='4s'/>, just observe it working and digesting effortlessly for you. Now notice your lower back and how it is pressing against the surface you are on <break time='4s'/>, and if you feel any tension just say, please relax just a little more. Focus now on your pelvis <break time='4s'/> and hips <break time='4s'/> and notice any sensations you are having there. This takes you even deeper into a state of relaxation. Allowing your focus to move down each leg now <break time='4s'/>, slowly relaxing those as well. Your legs have been taking you so many places over the years and they deserve to fully relax. Notice this wonderful wave of relaxation moving down to your knees and down your lower legs, all the way to your feet <break time='4s'/> and the very tip of each toe <break time='4s'/>. Good, you are doing so well. Now that you have relaxed your body so well, I am going to count down from ten, and with each descending number your conscious mind will relax even more so, letting go of any beliefs that hold you back from your goal. Imagine that you are standing at the top of a set of stairs and when I begin counting, you will walk down the stairs. Ok, ten <break time='4s'/>, nine <break time='4s'/>, eight <break time='4s'/>, seven <break time='4s'/>, six <break time='4s'/>, five <break time='4s'/>, four <break time='4s'/>, three <break time='4s'/>, two <break time='4s'/>, one <break time='4s'/>, and zero <break time='4s'/>. Good, it's natural that your conscious mind gives less and less importance to the words that I'm saying, allowing your subconscious mind to be present right now. From now on you choose to be relaxed. You choose to be calm. You choose to be in control of all you do because your health is very important to you. Remember that it is natural for you to be healthy and happy. It is unnatural for you to have sickness and misery. Now hear yourself saying: Each day, in every way, I get better and better. In order to make change I challenge myself. Change is not comfortable, in fact it is inconvenient, so if I feel comfortable with the change I am making, I am probably not extending myself enough. When I have a negative thought, I acknowledge that I feel this way and then I release it. When another negative thought arises, I catch it quickly and I say with confidence, I acknowledge that part of me feels this way, but this thought does not help me right now. Each day, in every way I get better and better. Whenever I am presented with feelings of stress, I know my breath is there to soothe me and guide me into relaxation. Every single day, I become more aware of all the good things going on in my community, and in the world around me. When I feel that darkness is surrounding me, I know that the way to see light is to take three deep breaths, relaxing my mind and body by doing so. Each day, in every way I get better and better. In order to make great change, I challenge my thoughts. From now on I challenge every single negative and unproductive thought that arises. From this point forward, whenever you find yourself having negative unproductive thoughts, you will immediately say to yourself the word STOP. Let me repeat that to you so that it is perfectly clear. Whenever you find yourself having negative unproductive thoughts you will immediately say to yourself the word STOP, and as soon as you say the word STOP you'll find that the negative thoughts you were having will just disappear. This gives you the opportunity to start a new positive thought process. How do you feel? <break time='4s'/> Notice how you feel right now and take great note of exactly how you feel, right now. Good, now let's come to conscious awareness, bringing back everything that you learned today for the better. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

Place your arms at your sides, and keep your legs uncrossed to improve blood flow. As you begin this generalized anxiety relaxation, you might want to close your eyes or focus your gaze on one spot in the room. Take a deep breath in filling your lungs <break time='4s'/> and now breathe out emptying your lungs completely <break time='4s'/>. Breathe in again, through your nose <break time='4s'/> now blow the air out through your mouth <break time='4s'/>. Breathe in <break time='4s'/> and out <break time='4s'/>. In <break time='4s'/>, out <break time='4s'/>. Keep breathing slowly like this fully emptying your lungs with each breath. Your deep breathing calms and relaxes you allows your body to relax, to get just the right amount of oxygen and to feel calm. There is nothing you need to be doing right now and nowhere you need to be, except here, relaxing, enjoying this time for yourself. Enjoying this anxiety relaxation. You deserve this time and need this time to function at your best. This time of relaxation will allow you to be as calm and healthy as possible. This anxiety relaxation is a productive healthy time. You are looking after your health with this anxiety relaxation. As you continue to breathe slowly and comfortably turn your attention to your body. Notice how you are feeling physically. Without trying to change anything simply become aware of the sensations in your body. All you need to do right now in this anxiety relaxation is observe.  However, what you are feeling right now is okay. None of your physical sensations are cause for concern, though some of them may be unpleasant because they are signs of built up stress.  Just notice how you are feeling, noticing any signs of stress and tension you may have without trying to change anything right now. Scan your body, beginning at the top of your head <break time='4s'/>, and moving downward. Turn your attention to your head <break time='4s'/>. Observe. Moving your attention downward to the level of your eyes <break time='4s'/>, nose <break time='4s'/>, chin <break time='4s'/>, down to your shoulders <break time='4s'/>. Noticing each area, observing how your body feels. Keep scanning, gradually moving down your body.  How does your upper body feel? <break time='4s'/> Take note of any areas of tension. Nearing the center of your body at the level of your stomach <break time='4s'/>. How is this part of your body feeling? <break time='4s'/> Keep observing your physical state. Continue to scan your body, moving the focus of your attention downwards.  Reaching the level of your hips <break time='4s'/>, keep observing and moving your attention down. How does this part of your body feel? <break time='4s'/> Notice any tension without trying to change anything. Reaching the level of your knees <break time='4s'/>, how does this area of your body feel? <break time='4s'/> Keep scanning all the way down to your feet <break time='4s'/>. Take a moment now to scan your whole body noticing how your body feels as a whole. Where is your body the tensest? <break time='4s'/> Focus intently on this one area of tension and imagine the muscles here letting go of their hold becoming loose, becoming relaxed, letting the tension go. Releasing the tension bit by bit until this area relaxes. Feel the tension softening, feel the muscles as they loosen, lengthen warm and relaxing as if they are melting into relaxation. Notice where your body is the most relaxed. How does the relaxation feel? <break time='4s'/> Imagine that this relaxation is warm and tingly, moving growing, spreading to relax other parts of your body. Feel your body becoming more relaxed as the area of relaxation grows as you continue this anxiety relaxation. Imagine that the air you are breathing is pure relaxation. Imagine that the oxygen you breathe in is relaxation <break time='4s'/> and the carbon dioxide you breathe out is tension <break time='4s'/>. The air exchange is an efficient relaxation system. Feel the relaxation as you take it in through your nose <break time='4s'/> and relax your body adding to the area of relaxation already there. Expel your body's tension breathing it out through your mouth <break time='4s'/>. Continue to exchange tension and relaxation. Continue the anxiety relaxation exercise. Feel the relaxed area getting bigger as you breathe more and more relaxation into your body <break time='4s'/>. Breathe out tension and feel the tension getting smaller <break time='4s'/>. Breathe in relaxation <break time='4s'/> and breathe out tension <break time='4s'/>. Each breath in adds to the relaxation a full breath more of relaxation is added to your body. Each breath out removes any tension. Keep breathing in relaxation <break time='4s'/> and breathing out tension <break time='4s'/>. More and more relaxed with each breath. Soon the areas of tension are very small. Your breathing can eliminate them entirely.  Imagine breathing out any last bits of tension <break time='4s'/>. You are feeling so calm, so relaxed,  breathing in relaxation <break time='4s'/> and breathing out tension <break time='4s'/>. Breathe in <break time='4s'/>, relax. Breathe out <break time='4s'/>, relax. Keep breathing smoothly and regularly relaxing more and more deeply with each breath. Now as you continue this anxiety relaxation, scan your body again noticing how your body feels now. Imagine that your body is made of caramel, chocolate, or some other solid that can be melted.  Right now, your body is like a solid hard piece of caramel. Imagine a feeling of warmth starting in your hands and feet that starts to soften the caramel that your body is made of <break time='4s'/>. Soon your hands and feet are soft, getting softer and more liquid <break time='4s'/>. The warmth spreads throughout your body, from your hands <break time='4s'/> up to your arms <break time='4s'/>. Feel your arms melting, softening. It is a pleasant feeling, so relaxing. Feel the warmth as it continues up from your feet <break time='4s'/>, up your legs <break time='4s'/>. Notice your legs softening as if they are melting to a completely relaxed state. Feel the core of your body as the warmth coming from your arms and legs meets at your stomach <break time='4s'/>. Feel your core relaxing melting. Imagine that your whole body is very soft like caramel that has melted and is soft and stretchy. Simply rest enjoying this relaxation. Floating relaxing.

It can be understood as simply showing up for happiness with a caring presence. As you train the mind to rejoice in happiness, you gain many benefits.

Find a comfortable posture and invite in relaxation from the beginning of your practice. As you breathe, appreciate the life offered from each inhalation. With the exhalation, let go of any tension in the mind or body <break time='4s'/>. Bring to mind a time in which you recently experienced happiness. It may be something small, like seeing a friend, watching the sunset, or the simple joy of lying down at night. When you have something, allow yourself to feel the experience of contentment. With the intention of cultivating gratitude, offer yourself a few phrases of appreciative joy. Keep the memory in your mind and offer these phrases: May my happiness continue. May my happiness grow. May I be present for the joy. May I appreciate the joy in my life. If your experience feels more like contentment or ease, you can substitute the words that resonate with you. You know your own experience, so be true to yourself. Offer the phrases silently in your head, finding a rhythm with the practice. Focus your attention on the words, the intention of appreciating the happiness, and the feeling of contentment from your memory. After five minutes, release the memory and the phrases from your mind. Bring to mind somebody else in your life who has experienced some happiness recently. Picture this person in your mind, smiling as you observe their joy.

Many survivors of very difficult circumstances will get to this stage in this mindfulness path with an even stronger sense of themselves and a deeper appreciation for their own resourcefulness. But trauma and deep internal challenges can leave its mark on confidence, attitudes, relationships, and behavior long after the core wound has healed. Mindfulness practices can help you to feel more confidence in yourself, restoring you to your own original authenticity. Over time, you may have developed the tendency to over monitor everything in your experience, looking out for signs of danger, harm, or anything unpleasant. Of course, it's healthy to look out for danger, but it can be unhealthy if we're not balancing it out by remembering ninety nine percent of the time when we're actually ok in each present moment. So, if you learn to acknowledge your monitoring without letting it take over, you will stop undermining your confidence in your current state of okness. By opening up to and bringing mindfulness to all of the positive states of being throughout your day, your sense of self confidence will grow bit by bit, drop by drop, until your water bucket of self confidence is full and embodied. The more you open up to your sense of being ok in this moment, moment by moment, the more your nervous system will relax, the more embodied you will feel, and the more internal resources you will feel are available to you. By also bringing mindfulness to more and more moments of safety, health, happiness, and peace, you will automatically increase self confidence within you, and feel more confident about others. Excellent, well done. I hope you feel more confident about yourself in this moment. To recap, trauma can leave its mark on confidence, attitudes, relationships, and behavior long after the core wound has healed. You may have developed the tendency to over monitor everything in your experience, looking out for signs of danger, harm, or anything unpleasant. By opening up to and bringing mindfulness to all of the positive states of being throughout your day, your sense of self confidence will grow bit by bit. I hope this has been helpful for you. Thank you for your mindfulness practice! </speak>","weight": 1}]}

Inhale, noticing sensations of breath <break time='4s'/>. Exhale, noticing sensations of breath, as the belly rises and falls <break time='4s'/>. We'll now shift into this practice of joy, by bringing to mind someone who we really believe has our best interests in their heart. Someone who has extended kindness and support to us. This could be someone we know now or someone from the past. A friend, family member, teacher, colleague. Choose just one person and bring them to mind as though they were seated right in front of you. Smiling at you. Imagine them truly wishing for you to be happy, fulfilled. For you to have a life that is flourishing. Imagine them beaming this towards you in their smile, in their eyes.

So, for a couple more breaths, really take in this wish of well, happiness, joy from this person who cherishes us <break time='4s'/>. Letting go of the image of this person, notice if in the body there is any emotional residue. Feelings of warmth or goodness. Ways we can identify what it's like to receive this wish of happiness. Then relax into these sensations and feelings for just a couple breaths <break time='4s'/>. With this feeling of support and happiness, we can now extend this boost of joy to others. Bring to mind someone in your life who could really use an extra boost a friend, family member, or colleague. And, again, bring them to mind vividly as though they were right in front of you. And without too many stories, or thoughts, or ideas just call upon this experience of wishing this person to be truly happy, fulfilled, joyful. As you inhale, draw in this intention <break time='4s'/>. And as you exhale, wish this person happiness, fulfillment, flourishing <break time='4s'/>. Once more, inhale, drawing in this intention <break time='4s'/>. And then exhale, sending out <break time='4s'/>. Release the image of this person.

Recognize that these positive qualities do not appear accidentally, they are the direct result of your effort. Rejoice in the effort that you're applying to your meditation right here and right now. Rejoice in that effort and rest in awareness of the joyful benefits you're receiving. Understand that while joy is a result of your practice, joy arises when we joyfully practice. Joy is only revealed through consistently applying effort. Joy is revealed through joyful practice. Joy is both the cause and the result. So, joy then, must have been within you all along. Joy is not gained through practice but revealed. The more you tap into joy, the more you apply joy to your effort, the more you experience joy as the result, the more you notice joy arising. You have always had the potential to be joyful, you have always had the potential to notice, to be mindful. You are joy, you are awareness. Rest, in the sensation of joy.

Find a comfortable position that allows your spine to be long but with a natural curve in the low back. You can close your eyes or keep them open with a soft gaze downward a few feet in front of you. Let the belly and shoulders relax. Today I'll guide you through a practice to envision a positive future. It's a chance to connect with that place inside us that wants to work toward a life of meaning and fulfillment. This is a useful way to consider how we care for ourselves and others and how to show up at our best to meet life's challenges. Before we start, take a full breath in <break time='4s'/> and a long breath out <break time='4s'/>. Now allow the breath to find its natural rhythm in and out, allowing yourself to be fully present resting on the breath. I'll provide you with questions to prompt ideas and responses that can help to find a positive future. Throughout this practice, let your body and mind feel loose and open. Repeat the questions I offer silently and to yourself. Resist the urge to solve problem and see if anything comes up on its own organically. If nothing comes to mind you can always continue to rest your attention on the breath until something comes up. Let's begin. Ask yourself, what kind of a future do I feel deeply moved towards? <break time='4s'/> Notice the thoughts, feelings, and images that come to mind. Meanwhile, remembering to breathe, breathing in <break time='4s'/> and breathing out <break time='4s'/>.

See yourself right now somewhere in this positive future and reflect on the things that you did that enabled you to get there. See yourself doing some of those things. Maybe it's spending time with family, maybe it's engaging in a daily practice that supports clarity and focus, maybe it's putting your energy into learning new skills, or maybe it's how you allow yourself to connect with others. See those things in your mind's eye and notice what it feels like as you imagine doing them. You can come back to this meditation at any time to rediscover connection to that place inside that's ready to create that positive future. We all have the ability to improve our lives and the lives of those around us. Can you take this feeling with you as you head back to your day? <break time='4s'/> Can you allow it to guide how you interact with your world now? <break time='4s'/> Let's finish this positive future practice now by taking a full breath in <break time='4s'/> and a long breath out <break time='4s'/>. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

Remain connected to the body and the breath, aware of body and breath. Feel how the body seemingly breathes itself. Notice into the wonder of the rise and fall of your chest, the wonder of the continual movement of breath. Soften into a deep feeling of gratitude for the body itself and your breath. Sense your heart opening to the miracle that is your body. Recognize all the wonderful ways in which it functions and all the amazing ways in which it allows you to connect with your world.

Label that sensation as happiness, as joy, or as bliss. And sit with it. Hold your subtle inner smile and explore. Notice what arises. Notice too, that this sensation of joy is available to you right here, right now, doing something as simple as sitting still, watching and noticing. The more you can be present, the more you can free yourself from thinking about what comes next, the more you can free yourself from ruminating on what has already happened, the more you are available to notice this joy. Notice that joy doesn't so much arise, but joy is revealed. Joy is most available to you when you are available to be nowhere other than right here, right now. Rest your whole body in this state of joy and identify with this bliss as who you really are. This happiness, this joy, this bliss, is what remains when you drop all your superficial thinking and doing. It's what remains when you're nowhere other than present, right here. This joy is you. It is your natural state. Recall this sensation and remember that this joy, as you, is available to you at any time. Anytime you'd like to come back to this feeling all you need to do is stop what you're doing and notice. So right here, acknowledge the ease, the spaciousness. Acknowledge gratitude and awe. Acknowledge your inner smile, and the sensation of joy. Get to know joy in this moment. And make a promise to remember joy, to turn towards joy, and to notice who it is that you truly are even as you return to your day. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

I'm happy you made the choice to meditate today, and nurture your body, mind, and soul. Let's get into a comfortable seated position. Close your eyes. Now, bring your hands together and take a moment for gratitude. Focus on what you have to be grateful for today. I am grateful for this new day. I am grateful to be alive. I am grateful for my loved ones. I am grateful for the sun, our earth, and the air I breathe. I am grateful for this moment of peace. Release your hands back to your knees. You can choose to face your palms up for receiving, or down for grounding. Take three deep breaths with an open mouth exhale.<break time='4s'/> <break time='4s'/> <break time='4s'/> Feel the relaxation flow through your body. Then, close your mouth and breathe through your nose for the rest of this meditation. We'll start with bringing awareness to and relaxing the entire body. Relax your forehead and your eyebrows. Relax all your facial muscles. Breathe in, and on your exhale, relax your shoulders down. Relax your arms. Relax your hands and your fingertips. Relax your heart. Relax your stomach. Relax your hips, your thighs, your knees. Relax your calves. Relax your feet. Relax your toes. Feel your entire body totally relax. Allow yourself to simply feel the stillness of this moment. You may notice your breath slowing down as your body calms down and finds stillness. Allow your breath to flow naturally. Just observe how your body naturally breathes in and out. Be the observer of your breath. Your body already knows what to do. If you notice thoughts entering your mind, don't worry or judge. Simply observe the thought, then let it go. Your thoughts are like clouds. A thought might drift across your mind and morph into another thought. You don't need to do anything but observe, then release. Like clouds, let them come and go. If you want, you can try this visualization, As you breathe in, imagine positive light energy coming into your body through your crown, which is the very top point of your head. As you breathe out, imagine that positive energy flowing through your body, all the way down your limbs, and pushing old, stagnant energy out through the tips of your toes. Breathe in positive, loving energy. Breathe out, and let that positive energy flow through you, washing away any negative thoughts, energy, and emotions that aren't serving you. Continue this visualization with your breath. In doing so, you're essentially trading low vibrational energy for high vibrational energy. We are energetic beings. We must learn to protect our energy and consciously choose to feed the positive and release the negative. As you feel the positive light energy surrounding you, feel free to recite these positive affirmations along with me, in your mind. I am worthy as I am. I am enough as I am. I am strong, I am brave, I am resilient. I love myself, respect myself, and accept myself exactly as I am. I am guided, I am protected, I am loved. I am safe. I can express myself freely. I choose love over fear. I am a lightworker and I lead with light. I am authentic to who I am and aligned with what I want. Now you have the tools to relax your entire physical body, renew your energetic body with positive light energy, and reset your mind with positive, loving affirmations. These exercises are available to you whenever you need them. Continue meditating on your own. Breathe, and connect with the stillness within. Begin to bring your awareness back to your breath. Bring your hands together and return to your gratitude. What about your life are you grateful for? Take three deep breaths with an open mouth exhale.<break time='4s'/> <break time='4s'/> <break time='4s'/> Open your eyes and see the beautiful world around you. Observe your surroundings with a fresh perspective, and continue your day with positivity and gratitude. Sending you love and light. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

Let me prepare the right practice for you.</speak>","weight": 0}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<speak> This is a twenty minutes guided meditation focusing on cultivating and experiencing joy. Regardless of what is going on in your world right now, we can experience joy. Let's get comfortable. Take a moment to find a place of rest where you can remain alert and still for an extended period of time. For some, this might be sitting on a chair with a relaxed yet upright back, on the floor or a cushion, or even lying down on the floor, such as in a constructive rest pose. Take three slow deep breaths.  <break time='4s'/> <break time='4s'/> <break time='4s'/> This is a signal to our body that we are taking a break from all that consumes us in our busy lives, and that we are entering into a sacred time. We are setting this time apart to nurture mind, body, and spirit, a time of renewal and peace. Let's begin by bringing focus to our breath. Take time to focus on the beautiful, minute detail of each breath, this breath of life ebbing and flowing through our body, being aware of the many ways that we experience this breath. You may notice the cool, gentle rush of air you're adding, and the warm exhale as breath leaves your body. You may notice the rise and fall of your chest, abdomen. With each breath, focus in on the joy it is to simply be and breathe. Right now, there is no need for you to do anything other than to simply revel in being. Notice the space between breaths where you gently hang between inhale and exhale, and again between exhale and inhale. Marvel at the amazing way our bodies have been created to continue this rhythm of life day after day, year after year. What a joy to have breath in our bodies. Joy is a state that transcends fleeting emotions; it arises from a deep sense of contentment and connection with life itself. As we take this moment to be still, allow joy to rise in your heart and mind. This joy is not dependent on external circumstances. Even in challenging moments, it is possible to access and experience joy by connecting with the present moment and cultivating a sense of gratitude. Breathe in this joy, allow it to fill your heart, allow a deep sense of knowing and appreciation that we can experience joy in spite of what is occurring around us. Joy is always within reach. Let's use this as our mantra for this time of stillness. As you breathe in and out, let these words slowly repeat in your mind with the rhythm of each inhalation and exhalation, breathing in joy, breathe out peace. Breathing in joy, breathe out peace. Allow your mind to meditate on this beautiful truth as we rest in the stillness. And should you find that you struggle to genuinely experience any sense of joy during this time, that's okay. This is not a time to feel self criticism or frustration. This joy is available to you whether you feel it or not. It is an inherent part of life, no matter what you feel right now. Practice gratitude for the potential of joy, even if your heart remains heavy. Simply allowing yourself time and space for stillness is a gift in itself. Trust that, over time, you will be able to more deeply connect with this sense of joy. And if you find your mind has wandered, whether it is dwelling on difficulties you are facing or simply drifting to other thoughts, memories, or plans, that's okay. Without judgment or criticism, gently bring your focus back to your breath and your mantra, breathing in joy, breathe out peace. You may even wish to personalize it further: breathing in joy, breathe out calm. This joy is ours regardless of our feelings or circumstances. It is a gift of life that transcends the ups and downs of daily existence. What an amazing reminder that joy can be ever present. As you inhale, breathe in this joy. As you exhale, feel it flow through your entire being. Continue to focus on this joy as you breathe in and out. If your mind wanders, gently guide it back to your breath, focusing on each inhalation of joy and each exhalation of peace, feeling it wash over your body. Remember that joy is not just an emotion; it is a state of being, an acknowledgment that everything we need for a fulfilling life is already within us. We have the strength and the ability to experience joy in every moment. As we near the end of this mindfulness practice, we prepare to reengage with the world around us, but we do so with an enhanced awareness of the joy that is within us. Take a moment to cultivate a sense of lasting joy that you can carry forward. Let this joy flow through you, helping to bring peace and calm to others as well. Go forward in peace, with joy as your companion. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

You want a short meditation practice for Positive Thinking. Let me prepare the right practice for you.</speak>","weight": 0}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<speak> This is a guided mindfulness meditation on embracing happiness. Begin with your breath, your constant, gently in and out. <break time='4s'/> Bring your presence into this moment, arms relaxed, gaze focused in the distance, or eyes closed, just allowing your body to be comfortable yet alert wherever you may be. Again focusing on natural gentle breaths in and out, <break time='4s'/> feeling the movement of air through your nostrils or your chest moving gently up and down. If we open ourselves to being available for each passing moment and maximizing contentment in what we call the here and now, we also open ourselves to the acceptance of happiness and contentment. Through this practice of being present, being mindful, and understanding the way that our mind works, we recognize how often our thoughts and stresses can lead the mind astray, digging into the depths of our subconscious and possibly with fear and angst, the lingering on what is wrong rather than what is right and beautiful. A place we can look is to what we can control within ourselves, realizing that happiness itself cannot necessarily be forced or planned, but if we orient ourselves toward contentment and presence, we can find peace in the present moment and awaken to the renewed possibilities of each new day. And so take this brief journey with me, and in bringing ourselves into this place of energy focus, continuing to recognize your breathing and your body here in this space, just count along with me whether out loud or in your head, reminding ourselves of breath and body each time going from five to one. We start now. Five, breath and body. <break time='4s'/> Four, breath and body. <break time='4s'/> Three, breath and body. <break time='4s'/> Two, breath and body. <break time='4s'/> And fully relaxed now with one, breath and body. <break time='4s'/> As you are here in this peaceful state of awareness, I ask you to think of a location that brings you great joy. This could be a vacation destination or a childhood home. It could be real or imagined, very close by or very far away. It could be associated with a joyful memory or simply have a wonderful and positive feeling. Take a moment to think about this place. What emotions and feelings arise when you bring your focus to this place: joy, comfort, a warm presence, a longing, perhaps a desire? Whatever you feel is okay. Embrace these feelings, welcome them, and observe them to understand what it might mean to have these thoughts about this place, and ponder why those thoughts arose. And as you embrace this focus, we will repeat some affirmations. You can repeat these again either out loud or in your head and just repeat slowly after me. Relaxed and present, open to joy, embracing comforting thoughts, mind calm and free, I surrender to this perfect moment. Awesome. Now in our next exercise, we will now focus on thoughts of a loved companion. It could be a family member or friend. It could also be a favorite pet. It could be someone who you see every day, or someone or something who is very far away. Just think of that meaningful presence in your life. Realize what thoughts of them come into your emotions, just as with the place that you focused on, it may bring joy, comfort, and a warm presence. It may even bring up other feelings such as melancholy, nostalgia, or even sadness if what you're thinking of happens to be far away or not here anymore. These or any other emotions are all okay because you are recognizing them, you are aware of them, so remember to embrace them, welcome them, observe them, coming to an understanding of what it means to have these thoughts as you think about this companion. And as you do so, bring them into your focus and let's repeat these same affirmations once again, again bringing that focus to the companion in your mind, repeating after me, Relaxed and present, open to joy, embracing comforting thoughts, mind calm and free, I surrender to this perfect moment. Great. Take this place you embrace and this companion you embrace, and allow them to help bring you into the present moment, day by day, hour by hour. At the end of this session, just allow yourself a few minutes to continue to stay in this presence and give yourself a bit of time to continue practicing presence and mindfulness. Remember that our lives are full of forces, ups and downs, high expectations, uncertainty, yet if we remain aware of what we most desire, to embrace our favorite places, our best companions, surround yourself with this presence of feeling, and you will slowly but surely discover a deep and beautiful subconscious contentment, which can lead to the moment to moment happiness that we so desperately crave that sometimes feels so fleeting. Remember this and take it with you into the days and weeks ahead. So again, taking these last few moments to deeply understand and recognize these lessons, we count down slowly now from five to one: five, <break time='4s'/> four, <break time='4s'/> three, <break time='4s'/> two, <break time='4s'/> one. <break time='4s'/> </speak>","weight": 1}]}

Although it may not always feel like it, joy can be your choice rather than a condition of if something happens or if you get something, then you experience joy. For today, let go of the I'll be happy when mindset. See your joy as available to you just on the other side of a door. You simply need to open it and let joy into your heart. Today, bring joy intentionally into your world and your heart. Find ease in stressful or challenging times and spread joy to your loved ones and around the world. I invite you to make yourself comfortable. You can lie down or be seated. Adjust your posture in any way that allows you to find ease in your body. If it feels right to you, close your eyes and soften the muscles around your eyes. Let your facial expression dissolve. Allow your jaw to release and settle into comfort. Make any small adjustments to your body to let go of holding, let go of tension. If you notice a gripping in your hands, your hips, or anywhere in your body, you can invite this area to soften and relax. Taking a moment now, at the beginning of our practice, to check in. Check in with how you are arriving, perhaps your motivation for practicing today. Check in to see what you might need during your meditation today and welcome whatever comes to the surface to be just as it is, with acceptance. Stay connected with your motivation, your intention for this meditation, and hold it in your heart. Invite your focus to move to the natural pattern of your breathing. Notice the nourishing quality of your breath. <break time='4s'/> Notice as you fill up with air on your inhale, <break time='4s'/> your body opens and expands, and you have the ability on your exhale to let go. <break time='4s'/> Continue noticing your breath as you welcome relaxation to wash over your body. <break time='4s'/> Soften anywhere you can. Notice your body being breathed without having to put effort toward this process, <break time='4s'/> no need to change anything. Simply allow your body to do what it does naturally. Experience your body breathing. Feel the life opening within you on each inhale. <break time='4s'/> Feel the expansion around your heart in particular. Sense the fullness and abundance of your inhale. And now notice your exhale. <break time='4s'/> Let your body release and sink down with your exhale. Give in to the sensation of letting go with each breath out. Allow your breath to be a tool to allow you to relax, to surrender to each exhale. Welcome each breath as a loving and expanding experience. Remaining as relaxed and calm as you can, invite your imagination to call to mind a person, a friend, or a loved one that makes you smile simply by thinking of them. This person is someone that is easy to love, and your love for this person flows easily and naturally. Perhaps you might say this individual brings you joy. When you have a person in mind, allow the image and the energy of this person to rest within your heart. Make space for the image or the energy of this person to stay within you. Perhaps imagine your heart expanding with the love you feel for this person. See and feel joy and happiness from this person. Perhaps you think of a specific experience or just the nature of this individual. Feel their joy and their happiness. If at any point you find your mind wandering, let the feelings of joy and happiness bring your attention back. And now imagine sharing in their joy. Imagine lifting each other up, supporting each other, and experiencing joy together. Sense this joy not only in your heart but throughout your entire body. Connect with this loved one's joy and positive energy as if it is intertwining with your own. Your energy is in training together with their energy. And as you continue to stay with the sensations of joy and happiness in your heart, you can repeat the following phrases in your mind or simply send positive energy to the individual that brings you joy, May you appreciate the joy in your life. May your joy continue and grow. May you live with joy and gratitude always. May you appreciate the joy in your life. May your joy continue and grow. May you live with joy and gratitude always. And now invite your attention to shift and begin to focus on yourself. Connect with a time in your recent past where you have experienced joy. Feel the sensation of joy in your heart and let that joy flow through your entire body, building from your heart. As you continue to stay with the joy in your heart and the joy in your body, you can repeat the following phrases in your mind or simply send positive thoughts and energy to yourself, May I appreciate the joy in my life. May my joy continue and grow. May I live with joy and gratitude always. May I appreciate the joy in my life. May my joy continue and grow. May I live with joy and gratitude always. Again, if you find your mind wandering off into story or thoughts, come back to the joy in your heart. And now invite this joy and your appreciation for this joy to expand, first expanding inside of your body, flowing out from your heart to all parts of your body. And then allow it to expand beyond yourself. Let the joy expand beyond your loved ones to all beings in this world, to all individuals in the entire world. Let your joy, your happiness, radiate outward to others. Linger in this sensation, linger in the feeling of joy for just a moment longer. Let it sink into your heart, into your muscles, and into your bones. Feel joy and appreciation in your body, knowing that you can cultivate or grow that quality anytime you choose. And now begin to sense the quality of a smile, a smile as the corners of your lips lift, the corners of your eyes lift, and sense the smile throughout your entire face. Notice the response of your body as you welcome a smile to your face. Notice as if the rest of your body can join in with your smile. Stay with this joyful smile and begin to bring some movement to your fingers and toes, bringing some energy back to your body, allowing your smile to build. And when it feels right, do open your eyes with a joyful, appreciative smile on your face. May you appreciate the joy in your life, may your joy continue and grow, may you live with joy and gratitude always, and may you spread your joy with those around the world, perhaps with a simple smile. Thank you so much for practicing with me today. I hope you have a wonderful day. </speak>" ,"weight": 1}]}

I am grateful to have the opportunity to share the beauty of meditation with so many people around the world. I do believe that the more people are practicing, the more positive energy is out in our world. Today's practice is one of a series of meditations about exploring and learning from the lessons offered to us by nature. The cycle of the seasons, year after year, has a lot to teach us and has a lot of similarities to the seasons we may experience in our own lives. Each season has meaning and can invite contemplation of these connections of nature to our own experiences. It is not even necessary to practice this meditation during the season in explorers, although you can. For today, let us contemplate the lessons of the season of summer. Let's begin now. I invite you to find comfort, find effortless ease in your posture, allowing yourself to be fully supported for this time of introspection and exploration. Choose an open and receptive posture, welcoming whatever comes to the surface. You can close your eyes or simply soften your gaze to a single point of soft focus. Take a full deliberate breath in through your nose and breathe out through your mouth like a sigh,  <break time='4s'/> letting go completely, letting go of your breath and any tension you may be carrying.  <break time='4s'/> Take your in breath as fully as you can, filling up completely.  <break time='4s'/> Notice the momentary pause at the top of your inhale, then breathe out intentionally, slowly, taking your time to notice all there is to witness about your exhale.  <break time='4s'/> Take three more deep breaths like this, settling in, letting go. With each breath in, sensing your breath filling you up with light, perhaps the light of the sun, each breath out, letting go of the darkness of winter within. Welcoming these breaths as a signal to your body and mind that you are ready for stillness, you are ready to look inward with curiosity. Sense the freedom of the relaxation and peace you experience. Fall is a time of letting go of what no longer serves you, letting go so you can welcome in change and new beginnings. Winter can be a time of stillness to go within, perhaps planning for the future and nurturing what is important to you. Spring brings a sense that your soul is rested and renewed and at the same time, it carries the potential of new beginnings and growth. Today, consider what summer has to teach us. Summer is bursting with light and growth and freedom. These symbols of nature's seasons may relate to different seasons of your life that you have experienced in your past or will experience in the future. The reminder is that everything changes and goes through stages. As you settle into the stillness of your practice, contemplating the lessons of each season, take a moment to notice what is there for you right now. And now, bring your awareness to the sensations in your body. Welcome this simple yet focused scan of your body to bring about the effect of relaxation. Allow your attention to rest on your current physical experience, allowing it to be just what it is in this moment. Notice how your body is meeting the surface below you. Feel the points of contact, let go into the support, let go of holding, and be open. Look for anywhere you can soften just a little more. Sense the support below you and invite in the light and the aliveness of the energy of summer. The energy from summer sun is peaceful and brings the sense of freedom. With a relaxed awareness, continue to scan your body from the inside, perhaps feel how your clothes are touching your skin, sense the air around you lightly brushing against you. Allow your attention to rest on the sensations of your hands. What is there for you now? Feel the energy of your hands from the inside, perhaps you feel vibrations or tingling, maybe you can sense the temperature of your hands. And begin to sense your feet now, what is your experience at the area of your feet? This practice is about looking inward, not about what you find, it's that you're looking. Looking inward can have a profound effect of relaxation on your mind and your body. Welcome this calm state, give yourself the gift of peace. The lessons and energy from each season can change our mood, it can change our perspectives and therefore our choices. As we explore nature's seasons, we can recognize that all things change, all things are beautiful and perfect in their own unique way at just the right time. Nature doesn't rush its process, all changes happen, seasons change, and everything gets accomplished without worry. Life, nature, and every person experiences a balance of giving and receiving, of expending energy and conserving energy. During the summer months, the sun's presence is great and the days are longer. The high sunlight eliminates the shadows, it takes away the darkness, it sheds light on the truth and any secrets being pushed down. It reveals things we may not have seen before. Summer gives us the opportunity to come out of hibernation, to uncover and explore the warmth of the sun experienced out of darkness. The symbolism of summer brings a time of light, of joy, of vitality, and of growth. The plants and flowers are blossoming, there is light and life everywhere you look. There is an energy of freedom and new growth. We can celebrate the light of consciousness within. We can open to the sun shining its light on our darkness. Notice now what's coming up for you as you contemplate the state of freedom and enlightened consciousness. Invite yourself to open to the light, open to what shows up without judgment, accept with love and nourish what is showing up for you now. Now is the time to perhaps allow and embrace something new that is being uncovered by the light of summer sun. Take some time to be with what is coming up for you now, be with what is being illuminated, feel the sensations, experience the energy. What is the sensation you are experiencing now? What is the quality of the sensation? And what is the intensity? Breathe this in now, be patient and listen to what your body is telling you now, listen to what your soul is sharing with you now. Continue to be receptive to these sensations for a few moments longer, with love and kindness for yourself, feel that they are blossoming within you in this season of light and freedom. Take another deep breath, feel the light, feel the freedom of the energy of summer, fill up fully with this energy of summer. Bring your awareness to the sensations of your body and the energy of your surroundings, sense the energy building within you once more, knowing that like nature, the sun shines the light on what we may not have seen before. You have taken the time to go inward, to accept and nourish what is true for you. When you are ready, open your eyes, let the light in, open your field of awareness now. Trust the journey, listen, observe, and be patient. Look for the seasons to change, the energy to change. Be open to change with acceptance, trust the journey. Thank you for practicing with me today. I hope you have a wonderful day. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

Before you begin, it's good to wear comfortable, loose clothing. You can lie down or sit comfortably; you can sit in a chair or cross your legs with your hands resting one over the other in standard meditation pose.  Now, close your eyes. During this time, know that you are allowed to release yourself from the tasks of the day and the responsibilities you have, just for a little while. Let yourself be free to explore, smile, and experience bliss. Bring your focus to your breathing. Feel your breaths grow longer and deeper. Take a few moments to breathe in <break time='4s'/> and out <break time='4s'/>, letting yourself leave the outside world behind. In your mind's eye, imagine a path. It can be any type of path you choose, but at the end of it, you see a door. This door opens to your inner world. As you push the door open, you see a ray of light. It is warm and inviting, allowing you to relax. This is your inner world. Step into this beautiful world. Relax into the warmth and harmony. Only you know about this place. Take a deep breath <break time='4s'/>.  Close the door to the outer world. Let yourself fully engage into this inner world. A world where you are safe and can experience happiness. Allow yourself this special time to work on your levels of happiness so that you may spread joy within yourself and eventually radiate it out. It's okay if your mind wanders. When you realize you have gone on a thought tangent, it's all right. As you are able, bring your awareness back to this meditation. To the sound of my voice. Now, take a deep breath <break time='4s'/>.  Feel your toes and feet begin to relax <break time='4s'/>. Feel your legs relax <break time='4s'/>. Feel your thigh muscles loosen <break time='4s'/>, followed by the muscles in your abdomen <break time='4s'/>. Gently tell them to relax. Moving up your chest <break time='4s'/>, relax the muscles around your ribcage <break time='4s'/>, and release the muscles around your back <break time='4s'/>. Feel the muscles in your shoulders releasing tension <break time='4s'/>. Now, let the muscles in your neck relax <break time='4s'/>, followed by all the muscles surrounding  your head <break time='4s'/>. Take another deep breath, let the air gently fill your lungs <break time='4s'/>.  Breathe out, allowing yourself to exhale until no more air is in your lungs <break time='4s'/>. Breathe in again, feel your lungs expand <break time='4s'/>. And breathe out <break time='4s'/>. Breathe in through your nose for a count of four <break time='4s'/>. Hold <break time='4s'/>. Breathe out through your lips for a count of eight <break time='8s'/>. Breathe in <break time='4s'/>. Breathe out <break time='8s'/>. Imagine the path you were on when you entered your Inner World. Continue that same path. You are surrounded by the same golden light that you first saw. The path upon which you are walking is well marked in a rich alpine forest. White pine trees line the path. The morning sun shines brightly above you, casting golden rays of light all around you. You walk until you find a rock outcropping overlooking a mountain vista. Hundreds of peaks span the horizon. Some are near, and some are farther away. As you gaze at the expanse of mountains, a feeling of peace comes over you. Nature's beauty is so precious, and she gives us this gift so freely. You take in this beauty. And you allow yourself to smile: to smile at the jeweled blue and green mountain peaks. The golden rays illuminate the landscape, and gently mix light and color so that the view looks like a painting. Smile as you become aware of the wonderful plants and animals around you. The sound of birds singing their morning song reaches your ears. You notice a large tree near you. It is old, as the girth of its trunk is very large. The papery bark tells you that it's a sweet birch tree. The leaves smell of sweet wintergreen. A few leaves fly away from the tree in a warm, gentle wind. One lands in your hand, and you smile as the leaf gives off its minty scent in your palm. You smile at this marvel and take a deep breath. <break time='4s'/> There's something else. Besides the glorious aroma, the leaves start to make beautiful sounds like a beautiful stringed dulcimer as they flutter in the mild wind. Light, airy sounds. Sounds that have a beautiful, melodious tone that complement the golden rays of light all around you. Now you're surrounded by golden light and glorious sounds. As you listen to the music, you feel your heart lifted and full of joy, there's such beauty all around you, making your senses dance in euphoria. Next to the tree is a bush with emerald leaves ending in triangular points. At the base of the leaves are small berries that resemble raspberries, but they are lighter red in color and smaller. They are wine berries growing in abundance all over the bush. You pick a few and eat three at once. The sweet tangy flavor makes your mouth water. You close your eyes and savor the flavor. As you chew and swallow these delicious fruits, you feel a warmth and energy emanate from your core. Life giving energy rises within you and makes its way out through your head <break time='4s'/>, arms <break time='4s'/>, core <break time='4s'/>, and legs <break time='4s'/>. You feel this energy as a life force that grows stronger with each beat of your heart. All your senses are in ecstasy. You feel a sense of calm appreciation for this beautiful bounty you're able to experience. You look out toward the berry bush and poplar tree, and then back out to the landscape. The sun is even higher in the sky now, and you can make out beautiful flowers dotting the landscape in pastels. Splashes of crimson and gold also speck the landscape. More scents come to your nose, honeysuckle, rosehips, lilac <break time='4s'/>. The bliss you feel at nature's richness radiates within your body. This powerful energy continues to radiate out of your core <break time='4s'/>, out of your head <break time='4s'/>, and out of your feet <break time='4s'/>, casting more light all around you. You look up and see a golden aura of energy surrounding your body. It's pure energy and light, and you can't help but smile. You bask in this life force energy combined with the sunlight and feel every muscle, every cell, every part of your being infused with nature's happiness. You stay here for a few moments, just listening to the sounds of the music, smiling, taking it all in. Now that you are infused with this golden energy all over your body, you are ready to leave this inner world. It has infused you with the tools you need to return to your day with bliss, more energy, and more happiness. The beautiful vista looks more golden through your aura of energy. You feel strong and vibrant. The smile on your face grows wider and a sense of gratitude comes over you for having the chance to visit this special place. You turn to go, but the beautiful sound of the leaves keeps you still for one moment longer. The notes beckon you to stay strong, and to radiate your beautiful golden energy out to the world. Once more you take a deep breath in <break time='4s'/> and breathe out <break time='4s'/>. Once more you encounter the scent of sweet mint. Slowly, you start to walk back up the path. You see an eagle flying in the distance. Its wings span a great length, and it stares at you. As a final gift, it sends you more energy and light to soar in your outer world. You continue to walk back up the path. The music from the leaves still plays as you approach the door. Slowly you pull it open and continue on the path to the outer world. You arrive and stop for a moment to take a deep breath <break time='4s'/>.  You hear the music from the leaves fading out as you return to your outer world. You breathe in, slowly and deeply <break time='4s'/>. Then you breathe out slowly, deeply <break time='4s'/>.  Breathe in <break time='4s'/> and hold <break time='4s'/>. Now breathe out <break time='4s'/>. Take one more deep breath in through your nose <break time='4s'/> and out through your mouth <break time='4s'/>. Slowly open your eyes and feel the energy of your inner world shining through and the golden energy that surrounded you is still there, radiating from your core. Smile and take one more deep breath as you return to your day <break time='4s'/>. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

Find a comfortable place where you can either sit or lay down. When you're ready and comfortable, close your eyes. Now, begin to relax your breath, inhaling through your nose <break time='4s'/> and exhaling out of your mouth,<break time='4s'/> relaxing all the tension, all the contraction, and the stress in your body as you exhale, and as you continue exhaling the tension and the contractions, your body begins to expand. As your body expands into the emptiness of space, all of the muscles, all of the organs, all of the fibers, and all of yourself relax. As you expand into space, you find yourself feeling lighter and lighter, more and more open, more and more expanded. With each and every breath, the body opens and softens even more. As you breathe in, you take in the life, the love of the Divine.<break time='4s'/> As you exhale, you let go of the past, you let go of your memories, and you open and soften more and more.<break time='4s'/> As you open and soften more and more, floating in space, expanding in space, you feel your heart opening and relaxing. While you continue to open and expand into space, bring your awareness to your heart in space. Keeping your awareness in space, and as you place your awareness at your heart in space, you begin to gently smile. It's a natural smile, a gentle smile. You're smiling from space to your heart. As you smile to your heart in space, you feel yourself relaxing, you feel your body open and expand and relax even more. Maybe you can hear your heart beating, and as you hear your heart beating, you smile even more, smiling at your heart, smiling at your heartbeat, smiling at all the ways in which your heart and your heartbeat support your life, all of the functions of your body, all of the organs in your body, all of the cells, feeling grateful for your heartbeat, being grateful for each and every cell in your body, every fiber, every organ, every gland. And as this feeling of gratitude grows from your heart, it moves outward. Each and every cell of your body begins to feel the gratitude all around your body. And as you continue to relax and to smile, to expand and to open, you continue to feel more and more grateful, and the feelings of gratitude continue to flow out all around your body, filling the space all around you so that anything in your field is met with this feeling of openness, expansion, and gratitude. Anything from the past that was painful is blessed with this feeling of gratitude and appreciation. Any past suffering, anyone, anything, any place, any event, any situation that was challenging is blessed with this feeling of gratitude. Thank you. And with this blessing, with this gratitude, as your heart continues to open, all of these things from the past fall back into nothingness, back into the field of energy where they came from, and the feelings of gratitude continue to grow more and more. You feel your heart blossoming like a beautiful flower, and as you bless this flower with your love, with your gratitude, it continues to open and blossom, bringing about more and more feelings of gratitude for everything, everyone, every place, every situation, every event that's ever happened in your life, blessing everything in your field with this love, with this gratitude, and continuing to expand and open into the field, inviting new things into your field, connecting to things that may have felt separate from you in the past that are now so close. As you continue to cultivate these feelings of gratitude and appreciation, anything and everything in the field that resonates with this quality is coming into your field, merging with you, becoming one with you. And as you connect to those feelings of gratitude, more and more things for you to be grateful for are flowing into your realm of awareness. You become aware of all the blessings awaiting you, all the events, situations, people, places, circumstances that can bring about those feelings of gratitude, and it's so easy to see them. As you connect to the feelings of gratitude, as you continue to cultivate more and more love and gratitude and appreciation, you can see, you can sense, you can feel all of these experiences awaiting you. Let yourself connect to all of these experiences and feel the gratitude expanding even more. Your smile becomes even bigger. You are just so relaxed and open, completely surrendered to this experience of gratitude, opening. Now, if you'll connect to an intention, something meaningful, something really important to you in your life right now, whether that's connected to your health, abundance, success, relationship, your spiritual and mystical experiences, any experience that you want to bring into your field, something you're wanting to explore, to understand, to learn from. And as you connect to this intention in this state of gratitude, appreciation, and love, it's so easy for you to merge, to feel one with this intention. You have no doubt that you can receive it, that you deserve to experience it. And your heart expands and opens even more, and you can see and feel it becoming one with this experience as if it was unfolding right now before your own eyes. Feel how your body responds, how much more relaxed you become, how easy it is to breathe, how easy it is to walk around, feeling so light and so free. Feel how much more your heart opens and expands, your heart filled with gratitude, with appreciation, and love, as you merge completely as one with your intention. And in this state of gratitude, of openness, of appreciation, you have no doubt that there are many other experiences awaiting you in the field, and you can visit these experiences now or later. You can let your gratitude, the expansion of your heart, the openness of your heart, collapse space and time and bring those experiences into your field right now. And whether you do it now or later, you realize that you have the opportunity to connect to your intention, to have any of these experiences anytime you choose, anytime you move into the space of your heart and you expand into the field, connecting to pure consciousness, connecting to your unlimited nature, feeling free, light, open, and expanded. And this realization fills your heart with even more love, even more gratitude, knowing that you are alive, that you have the capacity to achieve anything that you want, to create, to let go, to recreate again and again in the field, in the field of love, of infinite love, the field of love that you are one with. And this realization that you've never been separate from this love, from possibility, opens your heart even more, and you feel even more gratitude. You smile, and you soften, and you open even more. How much more can you open? How much more can you smile to your heart? How many more blessings can you receive when your heart opens and expands in this way? Once again, this realization helps your heart open even more, expanding into the field, connecting you to infinite possibilities, to all potentials of vibrant health, unlimited abundance, freedom, creativity, and unconditional love. You are one with the miracles all around you, the blessings all around you, filled with this love, with this gratitude and appreciation for everyone, everything, every place, every body, every situation, every event, every potential in the field, one with possibilities, one with the infinite. You slowly begin to come back to your body, feeling each and every cell of your body filled with love, filled with gratitude. Your breath is filled with gratitude. It's easy to breathe, to feel the love all around you, and you are filled with love, filled with gratitude. As you come back to your body, in a new state, as a new you, expanded and open to all possibilities, open to the miracles and the mystical experiences awaiting you every day, feeling yourself in your body, so free and so light, so open and expanded, begin to gently deepen your breath, connect to the energy of the room around you that is now filled with your love and your gratitude, connecting to every object around you through this love and this gratitude. And when you're ready, awake and aware, grounded in your body, your heart wide open, ready to embrace all of the wonderful experiences awaiting you, open your eyes. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

I invite you to make yourself comfortable and free of distractions. Allow yourself to settle in, knowing this is a time for deep relaxation. Notice if there is any tension in your body or maybe there is a busyness in your mind. It's completely okay. Over the next several minutes, you will be able to let both your body and your mind descend into a pleasant sense of calm. If you haven't already, gently allow your eyes to close. For the next few moments, I will guide you to connect with your body, beginning by resting your attention on your breath. Observe the rhythm of your breath, expansion, and release. Now add a little ease into the flow. Your breath will be letting your body loosen a bit on each exhale. On the inhale, see if you can quiet your breath a little. Invite a slowing down of the inhale as if to minimize any sound that is produced. <break time='4s'/> Then as you exhale, <break time='4s'/> let a sigh fall out of your body, weighted to gravity, letting go deeper into the surface that supports you. Continue this process for several more breath cycles, a very slow, light inhale through your nose, <break time='4s'/> followed by a heavy exhale, <break time='4s'/> letting your body go a bit further. Now bring your attention to your feet. On your next exhale, release any tension you may be holding in your feet. Allow the heaviness of your breath to connect with your legs and soften them with your exhale, knowing that you are safe and supported. You can let your legs and hips begin to melt into the surface below you. Now feel the movement in your belly. Notice its rise as you inhale, notice its fall as you exhale. Unwind any lingering tension or gripping of your belly muscles. Allow your belly to swell and fall as if it were a lazy wave in the sea. Shift your awareness further up now to your heart space. Can you connect with your beating heart? There is so much of what makes you uniquely you held in this space. Your heart space will help guide you on this journey today. Deep down in your heart, you know exactly what you need today. I am only here to give you space to create what is needed and invite you to listen more deeply. You can go within and trust your heart to guide you, and in doing so, its warmth and energy will expand. Feel the space around your heart. Feel its energy beginning to expand in every direction. There is a light inside you and it needs to shine. As you continue to relax and connect with the light within your heart, you can begin to tap into your imagination for a little while now. You are safe in your mind to visualize yourself outside, standing at the edge of a meadow. This may be a familiar place or one that exists only in your imagination. Most importantly, you know you are safe, and you feel that there doesn't seem to be any rush to move. You are only taking in the scenery for now. It is an absolutely beautiful scene with a skyline over the horizon that is inviting your gaze. The light in the distance is filling up the sky beautifully. It is bright, yet your eyes are thirsty to take it all in. The meadow before you is full of soft tall grasses, rich in light greens and yellows, spreading into the distance where the horizon meets the bright sky. The temperature is just right, and the air is crisp and clean. As you gaze into the horizon, there appears to be a subtle flicker in the distant sky, a soft flash of light. It's not alarming at all but it invites your attention. You notice a flicker of a faint image. It's an image from your recent past. There are multiple images and they seem to be representing an area of your life where you desire to change. Something is telling you that you do not need to dwell on these images. These scenes are only reminders that these are moments of your past. You know in this present moment you are exactly where you need to be. Pause for a moment now free of judgment of what you are noticing. This is the moment you begin to move forward and act as the architect of your upcoming experiences. You begin to step forward into the grassy meadow, and although the grass is tall, as you step, the blades of grass fall down before you. It's as if your foot makes a light contact and the grass simply tumbles down like dominoes, revealing the direction of your path. Looking down at the falling grass, a beautiful glistening of yellows and greens captivates your senses. As you continue slowly, you notice the distant sky no longer shines with those previous images. It appears to be an inviting blank slate waiting for your new ideas and your new visions. It's time to declare to yourself where you are intending to go. This is a journey of your own design. You have a clear opening, a blank slate for this new year or new chapter of your life. You have created a shift on the horizon and you can steer the course of how your life's journey unfolds. Now is time to visualize a scene from this upcoming year, this next phase in your life. What is it that you want to see? How would you like it to unfold? Imagine a specific scenario, maybe an event you are attending, or an interaction with someone, perhaps a work experience or something that reflects how you will be spending your time. You are beginning to notice something emerge in the sky ahead. You can see yourself, you can see yourself having made the changes you desire, you see what it all looks like. You can look deeply as the image is revealed with even more clarity. There are multiple images or ideas, representations of you amidst several different experiences. Look at yourself, see how it looks to watch yourself fulfilled, look at your face, and see your emotions. How does it feel? Feel it in your body right now, sense what it feels like as if these changes have already taken place. Now think of the steps along the way to get there. Imagine those steps being laid out in front of you with ease throughout this beautiful meadow. You can see the path clearly now. There is a comfort emerging within your body. It is reassuring knowing you are exactly where you need to be and exactly where you intend to go. The sensation feels warm, it feels just right. There is a sense of building gratitude for your discovery today. This discovery is felt as a smile throughout your entire body. Take a moment to bask in this uplifting energy. Feel that you are embraced by the warmth and love you have created for yourself in this moment. Now let your attention gently arrive back into your body and the space it is occupying. Notice the felt sense of the room you are in. Acknowledge that something memorable has just taken place in this space. You can build on this going forward by connecting to this moment where you have created a shift. You will remember this moment in times when it is needed to lean on. This moment represents a pivot in your course. Rest your attention on your breath now. You have had time to completely relax, so your body and breath feel easy now. You have been truly nourished by your practice and your mind. Your mind has been inspired by your imagination. If you can dream it, you can create it. You have instilled a sense of confidence in your future. Begin to deepen your inhale with intention. <break time='4s'/> Use your inhale to energize your systems and come out of this experience ready to move forward with your day. <break time='4s'/> You are alive and clear headed, equipped with your share of the universe's infinite energy. When you are ready, open your eyes as you come into full awareness, ready for this new year or new chapter to unfold. I am honored to have been your guide today. Repetition and consistency are important for creating the life you desire, so repeat this practice often. I hope you have an easy and fulfilling day. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

Maybe a major disruption has happened in your life, or maybe you're struggling for no specific reason. Whatever your situation, know that you are not alone in this moment. It is completely okay to feel whatever you are feeling right now, maybe sadness, fear, confusion, pain. Just allow yourself to observe it. Remember, we are all human, and if we compare ourselves to other people, their lives may appear perfectly curated from the outside, but we may not know what hidden battles might be happening on the inside. Somebody is enduring and fighting to overcome a struggle, just like you may be. To struggle does not mean that you are not still strong, to ask for help is not weakness. Allow yourself just a few minutes to relax, to release, just to be here and step away from everything that is happening around you, everything that might be going through your mind. You have a lot on your shoulders, you're doing your best, you are stronger than you even think, and you can get through this storm, and the next storm. And just like the saying goes, this too shall pass, and there will be times when you'll feel like sunlight is peeking through the clouds. You can put one foot in front of the other and keep pressing forward to get through to the other side. This is all I meant to tell you today, and so if you like, you can spend several more minutes here in your time, reminding yourself of how strong you are, and how you are not alone, just taking it one step forward at a time, and my voice will drop away right now. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

Today we'll be focusing on the experience of feeling alone, and so to start, find a quiet and comfortable place to sit or lie down. Gently close your eyes and allow yourself to settle into this moment, ready to engage your inner world. Let's start here by taking a deep, slow breath, inhaling through your nose, <break time='4s'/> feeling your chest and abdomen expanding, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. <break time='4s'/> Now allow your breath to return to a comfortable pace, and imagine that each in breath that passes draws in warmth and comfort. Allow the rhythm of your breathing to ground you in this present moment. Now gently turn your attention to the sensations of feeling alone. Acknowledge this feeling without any judgment, it's a natural human experience. Recognize it as a wave in the ocean of your emotions. It comes, and it will go. Let's do a body scan now, starting from the top of your head and gradually moving down to your toes. As you scan, notice any areas of tension, and whenever you notice any tension in your body, imagine releasing the tension with each exhale. Feel yourself becoming more relaxed and at ease. While continuing to breathe deeply, remember that you are part of a larger world. You are like a thread, connecting you to various aspects of life around you, nature, people, the universe. Though you might feel alone, there may even be someone participating in this practice at this very moment. We are all connected throughout this world. See if you can reflect on the times when being alone has offered you a space for growth, rest, or creativity. Embrace the tranquility and potential that solitude brings. With each breath, draw in the strength and peace that solitude can offer. Now, let's shift our focus to the moments, things, or people in our life that we are thankful for. Gratitude can transform our perspective, providing a sense of companionship and even connection in moments of solitude. As this practice comes to a close, start to bring your awareness back to the present. Remember the sense of peace and connection that you may have cultivated here today during this practice, and remember that it is always available to access, even when you are alone. You can gently open your eyes and notice how you feel. Thanks for sitting. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

Where is it that you feel empty? See if you can identify the space in your body and begin to breathe into that space deeply, deeper than you have all day so far. <break time='4s'/> Breathe in slowly and deeply through your nose, and breathe out slowly through your mouth. <break time='4s'/> And again, an even deeper breath this time, <break time='4s'/> and exhaling out. <break time='4s'/> Continue to breathe in this purposeful way, <break time='4s'/> allow the air to gently fill that space, allowing it to relax, still, and feel more ease. Now let your breathing return to its normal pattern and rhythm, connecting now with the rhythm of your heartbeat, connecting your heartbeat with your breath, allowing it to relax you and anchor you into this moment, so that if you get distracted or your mind wanders, you can focus back on your breath to return you to the present. Emptiness isn't a thing, it's the absence of a thing. Usually, emptiness is the absence of love. We feel that we know what will make us happy and what would fill that empty space. The truth is, there's nothing outside of ourselves that will fill it. The journey is about understanding the false beliefs and the fears and the stories we've told ourselves about ourselves, and then beginning to release those. Those are the things that keep us searching for joy and love in things or in people outside of ourselves. Those are the things that keep us from seeing the joy and the love and the goodness that we already have. But we can look at those judgments and fears and false beliefs, and we can begin to surrender them, knowing that we don't need them anymore. We can begin to release those things and those people that we placed our happiness in the hands of. We think that the only reason we experience those feelings of love or acceptance or being full is because something or someone else is giving them to us. But what if those things and those people were simply mirrors showing us the depth of those gifts inside of ourselves? Now I invite you to find and celebrate the capacity for love and for joy that you have inside of yourself. Allow this session to settle into your mind and heart in its natural time, even long after it's done, fostering healing and ease, inspiring you to see and hear things in ways you haven't before. Now let's take three more deep breaths together, inhaling deeply <break time='4s'/> and exhaling everything out. <break time='4s'/> And again, another deep inhale <break time='4s'/> and exhale, <break time='4s'/> feeling that breath weave through every muscle and cell. Last time, your deepest breath yet, sending that oxygen all the way down to the tips of your toes, <break time='4s'/> and as you exhale, feel it circulating all the way up your body. <break time='4s'/> And when you're ready, you can open your eyes. Thanks for joining me, till next time. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

This practice is for those moments when you are feeling alone or disconnected. Remember, it's okay to feel this way, and it's important to take time for yourself to heal and grow stronger. So let's begin by finding a comfortable position, either sitting on a chair or cushion on the floor, with your back straight and your hands resting in your lap. Let's start here by taking in a deep breath, <break time='4s'/> holding it for just a moment, and then exhaling slowly. <break time='4s'/> As you breathe deeply for a few moments, notice the air as it moves in and out of your body, feeling the rise and fall of your chest and abdomen. <break time='4s'/> Now, allow your breathing to return to a comfortable pace, and gently close your eyes. Let's start with a brief body scan from the top of your head down to your toes, slowly scanning our attention down the body and then back up, noticing any areas of tension or discomfort, and with each breath, imagine sending healing energy to these areas, softening and releasing any tension, letting go of the discomfort here. Just sit in this space, remembering this is your moment of peace and solitude. Now, let's bring our attention to the present moment. As feelings of loneliness may sometimes be linked with thoughts of the past or anxieties about the future, it's important to bring ourselves back to the now. We can do this by focusing on the feeling of our body against the seat or chair, noticing the rhythm of the breath as it comes in and out on its own, and even noticing the sounds of the room around you, all without judgment, just noticing what's there in the present moment, allowing yourself to become more and more immersed in the moment. Whenever the mind wanders to thoughts, anxieties, or feelings, gently watch them pass on their own, and bring your mind back to the present, back to the breath, the points of contact, and the sounds around us. As you continue to watch the breath, allow yourself to recognize and accept your feelings of loneliness. It's okay to feel lonely, it's a human emotion and part of our shared human experience. Imagine these feelings as clouds passing by in your mind's sky; they are transient and do not define you. With each passing cloud, allow yourself to feel a sense of release and peace. Now, let's focus on cultivating a sense of connection. Imagine a warm, comforting light enveloping you, filling you with feelings of love, kindness, and connection. This light represents the universal connection that we all share, it's the collective human experience. We all experience moments of loneliness, and in that, we are all connected. Let the light remind you of this shared experience. As you breathe, feel the warmth and connection it provides. See what other feelings you can evoke here that allow you to feel more connected and loved. Now, as we begin to close this meditation practice, hold on to that sense of connection, that reminder that we are not alone, even in our feelings of loneliness. Take a few more moments to sit with these feelings of connection and shared experience, all while continuing to breathe and watch the breath, allowing your body to absorb this tranquility and peace. When you are ready, slowly bring your awareness back to the room, feeling the surface beneath you, hearing the sounds of the room around you. You can gently wiggle your fingers and toes, move your body around gently, and then, whenever you are ready, slowly open your eyes. Remember, it's perfectly normal to experience feelings of loneliness, it's part of our shared human experience, and through moments like these, we can learn, grow, and connect with ourselves and others. Thanks for sitting. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

As we begin this session, find a comfortable seated position where you can gradually let go of the tightness in all the muscles throughout your body. Allow yourself to breathe naturally and comfortably and begin settling into a state of relaxed and present awareness. In this meditation session, we will focus on finding a deep sense of peace within ourselves, even when we may be missing a person, group of people, or a pet who we wish was there to be with us and provide comfort in our most vulnerable times. It is also possible to feel lonely and isolated even when there are many people in our lives, or we may be missing someone who we've lost in either the recent or distant past. Meditating on this will help us recognize that feelings of loneliness are a natural occurrence, but if we practice mindfulness, it will help us be more present and at peace in each moment, better able to cope with whatever situation we find ourselves in. As you continue to get settled in, keep your attention on your natural breathing, gently in and out. Now that you are here in this place of presence, remain loose and relaxed throughout your entire body, focused and present in mind as you hear my words. I ask you to imagine a place or an event from the past. This could be from your childhood or recent memory, maybe an activity with friends or family, maybe a memory from a special moment in your life. It might be from somewhere with a pet or just a favorite place to get away and let your mind drift off. Instead, if you like, you can also create your own imagined place, maybe a relaxing beachfront, a forest path, floating in the clouds, or among the stars in space, bright, warm, serene. Visualize the space and, if you like, take a deep breath in <break time='4s'/> and out. <break time='4s'/> Let your mind deeply transport you to this place. Visualize what is happening all around you. Allow yourself to feel even more relaxed than you were just a few moments ago. Now, I'll ask you to do one more deep breath in this calming space, in <break time='4s'/> and out. <break time='4s'/> As you are here, perfectly content in this space, in need of nothing more, we will take one minute of silent meditation and contemplation starting now. By keeping this place of peace in your mind, remember that you can transport yourself back here at any time, whenever you might be feeling isolated or lacking a connection with people. As a reminder, meditation alone will not completely fill our need for human connection, but it can bring us reassurance and peace in moments when we may not have someone to immediately turn to. We can clear our minds, relax our bodies, and then decide and find the next steps to seeking companionship, love, and connection. As we finish today's session, I will leave you with five short phrases. I encourage you to use these, even write them down and keep them handy when you do short meditations throughout your day, and visualize your imagined place. You can do this anytime, so feel free to repeat these five short phrases after me, if you wish, beginning with, finding my place of peace, present and aware. I am calm within myself. I am connected to the universe. I am not alone. Fantastic job today. To seek further help with loneliness and feelings of being alone, don't hesitate to utilize the resources I provide in the video description, and of course, feel free to leave a comment and share your own experience. Nobody should be alone in this world, and there are ways to make those connections. For right now, use this meditation practice to find that peace and presence within this very moment. Within yourself, the pathway forward will become more clear. Thank you again for joining me, and goodbye for now. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

Loneliness is something we can feel even if our life is full of people, so whether you are feeling lonely as a result of being alone or you have this feeling even though there are people in your life, meditation can help us manage this feeling. To start, find a seat on a chair or cushion on the floor, and then sit with your back upright and comfortable, with your hands resting in your lap. Now, with your eyes open, start by taking in a few big deep breaths, breathing in through your nose <break time='4s'/> and then out through your mouth. <break time='4s'/> Now close your eyes, and let's acknowledge here a person in your life who needs you. It could be a friend or family member, a child or sibling that relies on you, a parent that you support, or a friend that you've done favors for. Just acknowledging here that even though we may feel lonely in this moment, we are needed. There is someone we know who appreciates us, even for the smallest things, and if you are struggling to acknowledge someone that you know here, think about someone who's benefited from you that you may not know or may not know you, someone who's benefited from maybe the work that you do at your job, someone who you let ahead of you in line, or maybe the last small gesture that you did for a stranger. Even small gestures can help people and make their lives just a little easier. So just acknowledging here again that even though we may feel lonely here, we are needed. We may have benefited someone's life without even knowing it, made someone smile, happy, and just be with this feeling for a few moments. Let's also acknowledge ourselves here, so again, even though we are alone or feeling lonely, we are with ourselves. Let's take a moment here to practice some self compassion. Wherever we go or wherever we are, we're always with us, so we need to remember to practice some compassion towards ourselves. The feeling of loneliness often comes packaged with feelings of depression, trauma, loss, grief, or crisis, and with this, we can be a little tough on ourselves. We might blame ourselves or get caught up in our thoughts, so let's bring to mind an image of ourselves. Visualize yourself when you were a child, how you looked and acted, the things you enjoyed doing, the physical place you were in when you were that age, and as you maintain this image in your head, realize that we start with this image because of our innocence. So whether or not you believe you can love yourself today, practicing self compassion to your younger self may be a little bit easier here. Let's begin to diffuse any negative energy or emotions and thoughts we may carry towards ourselves by imagining our current self giving wishes of well being to our past younger child self. Picture yourself standing or sitting in front of the child you, and in your mind, repeat to your child's self, may you live with ease, may you be happy, may you be safe, may you feel loved, may you be free from suffering. Now just picture your child self receiving these wishes of well being, imagining how happy they'd be, and if you genuinely wish these things for your child's self, sit with that feeling too for just the next few moments. Now let's open this up to ourselves, and so now, simply imagining yourself here, sitting where you are now, in the way that's easiest to bring yourself to mind, and then allow in your mind to begin to wish to yourself, may I live with ease, may I be happy, may I be safe, may I feel loved, may I be free from suffering. Now imagine yourself receiving these wishes of well being, imagine how you'd feel, the expression on your face, noticing the thoughts and feelings that arise, and just sitting with them for the next few moments. Now open your eyes and notice how you feel. Thanks for sitting. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

Take another deep breath, inhale all the way into your belly, <break time='4s'/> and exhale completely, emptying out. <break time='4s'/> Let's begin by anchoring ourselves in the present moment. Often when we feel lonely, we spiral into negative thoughts and convince ourselves of something that may not be true. Notice the seat underneath you, feel your entire weight drop down into it. There's nothing to hold on to, and nothing to be afraid of, for the same life force that brought you this far in your journey will also carry you through. Sit up straight, roll your shoulders up to your ears and down your back, and tuck your chin in slightly. Just breathe here for a few moments, noticing how just changing your posture makes you feel a little bit more courageous to face the loneliness. Even when we experience loneliness, it doesn't mean that we've done something wrong, it could just be that this is a chance for us to learn how to deal with difficult emotions and to learn to lean on a deeper sense of peace and surrender our worries. Now, let's invite the presence of a benevolent, loving energy into our meditation, one that promises to always be with us. If you feel comfortable, you can repeat after me: I invite peace and love into this meditation, may this presence be with me. Take a few deep breaths here, allowing this loving presence, the perfect expression of kindness and compassion, to walk into your physical space. Maybe you imagine this presence as a figure, a person in front of you, or perhaps it comes simply as a ball of light, a presence, or a bird, a cloud that rests in front of you and around you. As you breathe, allow your heart to enter into the spiritual reality where you are never alone. With each inhale and exhale, breathe in the presence of one who only wants to shower you with love. Now, this loving presence wants to help dissolve the feeling of loneliness that you experience, so notice in your body if there's a place where loneliness seems lodged in your being. Perhaps it's in your mind, where thoughts make you feel lonely, maybe it's your heart, feeling brokenhearted and alone, maybe it's in your gut, in deep memories from childhood, and maybe it's in your physical space where there's been discord and loneliness in your life. If you feel ready, let's invite this loving presence into wherever our loneliness is lodged and offer our loneliness to be healed and transformed. With your next inhale, imagine handing the loneliness over, taking it from the part of you that feels hurt, and physically letting it go. Watch as this loving presence transforms that loneliness, dissolves it, and wraps you in a deep, perfect love. Allow every muscle in your body to relax with each inhale and exhale, allowing every muscle from your face, your chest, your arms to relax. Just notice how you feel now, notice the sense that you're not alone, that there is love around you. Through every situation, you are never truly alone. Now, let's close this meditation with a simple reflection: Thank you for this presence of love, which surrounds us through every challenge and difficulty, allowing peace and warmth to permeate our hearts, so that we know deep down in our souls that we are never alone. Amen. Open your eyes, take a deep inhale, <break time='4s'/> stretch your arms up to the sky, and bring a gentle smile to your face, knowing that no matter what life looks like on the outside, the spiritual reality is that you are loved, cared for, and never alone. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

You see, I need you to stay with your breath right now because your breath is going to tell your mind and your body that you're safe. It's okay to relax. Only from that relaxed place in your mind and body can we truly understand what we need to about your loneliness. So stay with that beautiful breath, slow and steady. While you're breathing, I want you to use your imagination and reflect over the course of your life. Think back as far as you can to some of the earliest years, and open your mind to an earlier time when you may have felt lonely. You may be tempted to feel defensive or guarded. That's okay. With practice and a willingness to open to yourself, what you need to know will come. Once you've identified an early circumstance of loneliness, I want you to give that part of you a voice. Start writing out in a journal the things that that part of you needs to say. I want that part of you to ask for what it needs, and for you to be willing to nurture that part. With enough repetition and with enough sensitivity, over time you will begin to feel differently. I'm proud of you for doing this work, and it's not the type of thing that you do only once. It's something that you return to over and over again, to help you open the window to deeper parts of yourself, to greater awareness, and to use my voice to help you overcome the ache, to know you're not alone, and to avoid falling into those pitfalls of old behaviors. From me to you, in peace and healing.</speak>","weight": 1}]}

Well, I do too. That's why I designed this ten minutes guided meditation to bring you comfort and connection within. Let's begin. Find a quiet and comfortable space, allowing yourself to settle in. Sit upright, softening your shoulders, relaxing the muscles on your face, and closing your eyes. Take a deep breath. <break time='4s'/> When you breathe out, <break time='4s'/> let go of the weight you're carrying. This is a sacred time for you to connect with yourself and ease the ache of loneliness. As you breathe, imagine the gentle light surrounding you, a light of compassion and self-love. Feel it embracing you, radiating warmth, providing a sense of comfort and assurance. Now, take a moment to deepen your breath. Inhale deeply, <break time='4s'/> acknowledging any feelings of loneliness within you, and exhale, <break time='4s'/> releasing the tension associated with those emotions. Let your breath become a steady rhythm, like the rise and fall of ocean waves, observing your abdomen rising and falling, feeling your body sinking deeper into your seat. Feel your body's weight, shape, temperature, texture, and sensations. Feel the presence of your existence and continue your breath. Let it guide your body. Observe your body and mind. If you're wandering around, just observe. Be curious and see what is happening in your body and your mind. Simply observe and then let them go, as if watching the clouds moving across the sky. On your next breath, visualize a scenery of a landscape, a beautiful beach where the waves gently lap against the shore. As you stand on this beach, feel the ocean touch your feet, feel the sand beneath you, the humidity, the warm water, the sound of the ocean. Let the vastness of the ocean symbolize the shared human experience. You are not alone in feeling loneliness. It is a universal tide. It is in every human being. As we breathe, allow self compassion to grow within you. Embrace the knowledge that you can feel lonely, and yet you are still deserving of love and connection. Loneliness is a feeling, an emotion, an energy with motion, which flows through you and will go away. Now, picture a moment when you are surrounded by your dear friends and family who support and love you unconditionally. Feel the sense of warmth, openness, and acceptance. As we're getting close to the end of this meditation, if you want, you can hold your palm close to your heart and send loving compassion to yourself again. Thank yourself for acknowledging the feeling of loneliness, sending acceptance and self love to yourself. Now, you can slowly bring your awareness back to the room. Feel the embrace of self love and know that you're never truly alone. You will always be there as companionship for yourself. Well, this is the end of this meditation. If you found it helpful and it brought a moment of peace, consider subscribing for more guided sessions and wellness content. Share this video with someone who might benefit from it. Let's turn stress into strength. I'm here to support you. Until next time, remember, you're never alone on this journey. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

Let's begin by taking a few moments to get ourselves in the seated or lying posture where we can be comfortable and alert, and then just gently beginning to check in with this body and mind, acknowledging how you're feeling and letting be whatever is present physically, mentally, and emotionally, letting be, and now gently shifting to the mindfulness of breathing, becoming mindful of wherever you feel the breath in your body to be most prominent and distinct, could be in the nose, the chest, the belly, or other places, and resting awareness upon the breath, breathing normally, breathing naturally, being mindful of breathing in and breathing out. From time to time you may discover that your mind has wandered off into the future or past, and when that happens, very gently acknowledging wherever you went and then returning back to the breath again, breathing in and breathing out. And now gently withdrawing your awareness from the breath, begin to feel that sense of connection of your body on the chair, the cushion, the bed, or a mat. Feel your sense of connection to the body on the floor, the chair, wherever you are, reflecting on how this connection of your body on the chair or floor is connected to the building that you're in and to the earth that is supporting it all below. Feeling that sense of being held by the earth below you. There is nothing more that you need to do, just allowing yourself to be held by the earth. It is as you're being held by this earth that you are in a safe place, and you can just breathe with ease, in and out, in your own body and mind, being present. So, feeling this connection to the earth below you that is holding you and embracing you, that there is nothing more that you need to do, nowhere you have to go, no one you have to be, just being held in the heart of the kindness of the earth, and letting it all be, and letting the awareness expand to reflect upon it. May all your loved ones be held in the same way, with safety and ease in the body and mind, even expanding this reflection. How the earth holds all beings, whether they are acquaintances, strangers, even difficult ones, are held with no bias or discrimination, no separation, reflecting on how this earth holds all beings, forsaking none, being present. And so, just easing into this body and mind, feeling safe, feeling held by this earth, reflecting on how this earth does not exist in a vacuum, that it is indeed connected to a solar system and to a vast universe. Albert Einstein speaks about how the sense of separation is an optical delusion of our consciousness, that all of the elements that make up matter and energy are found within the universe, found within each and every one of us. Feeling that sense of your own connection and interconnection with yourself, with others, with this earth, with this universe, being present, feeling that sense of connection and interconnection, that these molecules that exist within us are found throughout this universe, that we are all made of the same stardust that is found in the stars. Expanding and feeling that sense of being home inside your being within this universe of belonging, connection, and interconnection. May we all be at ease and at peace, and just feeling that sense of the body as you lie or sit, feeling the sense of connection and interconnection as you breathe mindfully in and mindfully out, feeling the grace of this universe, no isolation, no separation, feeling that sense of connection and interconnection and being at home inside your own being. There is nothing more that you need to do or go or get or push away, just resting in the heart of this universe, being present. Here, as we come to the end of this meditation, taking a moment to just acknowledge this time of connection and interconnection, feeling your body as it's connected to the chair or floor, wherever you are, this connection to the earth, to the universe. May all beings here and everywhere be safe. May we all experience the gateways into our own hearts, and may we be at peace. May all beings be at peace. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

I'm so glad you're here, and if it feels comfortable, I'd love for you to visualize that we're in the same room together, wherever you are. Get yourself settled into a comfortable position and close your eyes, and let's jointly intend that all our energies today will be used for the highest good for all, taking a moment to settle your thoughts, settle your body, and settle your breathing, slowing down a little as you give your body and mind the space it needs. Inhale, <break time='4s'/> and as you exhale, <break time='4s'/> invite your eyes to relax, your eyelids softening. Inhale, <break time='4s'/> and as you exhale, <break time='4s'/> let your shoulders lower down. Inhale, <break time='4s'/> and as you exhale, <break time='4s'/> feel your torso letting go. Inhale, <break time='4s'/> and as you exhale, <break time='4s'/> feel your pelvic area ground down into your seat. With your eyes closed still, massage the area where the back of your neck and head meet, loosening up and releasing tension, and when you're ready, settle your arms back down. Loneliness is a feeling that will come and go, and it's completely normal, even in a busy house full of other people or in a busy office full of colleagues. Loneliness can occur. Keeping busy does not reduce loneliness, because it's about connection and closeness. There are things you can do to ease the feeling of loneliness, and the main mindfulness technique is to realize that your mind is your true home, so keeping your mind calm and uncluttered can help you feel connected to yourself. So let's make a decision to ignore the things that have been going on today, leaving that aside for now, and instead put all your focus on your breath, noticing the breath as it enters and leaves the tip of your nose. When you see a flower in a summer garden, you enjoy that moment when it's flowering, but as summer wears on, the petals start to fade and drop. The plant is still alive, still evolving. This fallow time is important, and even though it looks like they're doing nothing, that nothing is essential for it to show off new blooms next summer. You see, what you don't do is as important as what you do. Busyness, whether busy with tasks or busy with lots of people, won't take away loneliness, but being aware of your loneliness and making peace with how it makes you feel can help. When you make peace with your loneliness and anxiety, it might look like you're doing nothing, just like a winter plant, but often this is when the hardest work is going on, and it's when you need that calm mind most of all. Take a few deep breaths, breathing into your heart, breathing in and out of your heart space, and bring to mind someone whom you miss or want to connect with again, whether they're passed on from this life or are far away physically. Maybe they live close by and just feel distant. Imagine that person right now, really listen to that person, take this time to understand them, and you find yourself coming to understand how that individual sees themselves, and somehow now communicate to them that you care, that you see them, that you understand them. Imagine a glowing pink light surrounding both of you, feeling closer and more connected. And let's round off now with some affirmations: I cultivate love and trust in myself, I connect with myself so I can connect with others, what I don't do is as important as what I do, I accept myself exactly as I am, I have the courage to reach out and connect with other people, I have a lot of value and love to share with others, I enhance my life with laughter and good times, I invite people into my life and value their company, I trust that something new and enjoyable can happen to me, I can fully enjoy my own company, I love, care for, and connect with others. Loneliness is not who you are, and I want you to remember three things, keeping a calm mind means you can connect to yourself at any time, you can develop new social connections with new or old acquaintances at any point, and you can develop a closer relationship with people by really taking the time to understand what it's like to be them, kind of walking in their shoes. So now imagine for a moment you, myself, and others are meditating together, connected together in this moment. We are all uplifting you with kindness and love, surrounding you with positive energy. You are so supported, you are so loved, and as we allow these new energies to integrate, it's now time to bring your awareness back to your physical body, back to the room, gently breathing in <break time='4s'/> and gently breathing out, <break time='4s'/> and when you are ready, open your eyes. Thank you for meditating today with generation calm. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

In fact, there are so many different that really the only way we can work with loneliness is to look at the origin of it to better understand what it means to feel lonely and how that differs perhaps from being alone. Wherever you are right now, however you're sitting, just take a moment to get comfortable. Make sure you're not going to be physically disturbed in any way, and we're going to begin with our eyes open and a nice soft focus, the eyes just aware of the space around you. Then, when you're ready, just take some big deep breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth, and with the next out breath, <break time='4s'/> <break time='4s'/> <break time='4s'/> if you haven't done already, just gently close the eyes. Feel the weight of the body pressing down against the seat or the floor beneath you, the sensation of the feet on the floor, the hands and the arms resting on the legs, and just take some time to settle into the body and begin to notice the different sounds around you. Just bring the attention back to the body now, checking in with the body, noticing how the body feels today, how it feels right now, and in your own time, just scan down from head to toe, building up a picture of how the body feels, not thinking about the sensations, just becoming aware of those sensations. As you scan down the body, just become more aware of the feelings and sensations in the body, especially the movement of the breath, the rising and falling sensation, just noticing where in the body you feel that movement, and slowly becoming more aware of the rhythm of the breath, starting to notice each and every in breath and each and every out breath, just allowing the body to breathe in that way with no effort required. I'd just like you to imagine, in the middle of your chest, in the middle of your body, just a little pinprick of light, almost like a little glimmer of sunlight. As you become aware of that, just imagine that it's expanding outward in each and every direction, to the front, to the back, to the sides, upwards, downwards, almost like a ball expanding in every different direction. As you watch this, it's almost as though it's happening on its own, you're not making it happen, there's no effort required. You're just watching as that sense of sunlight, that sense of warmth, expands and begins to fill every part of the body. Just continue in that way, as you continue to watch that sense of sunlight expand, the body feeling increasingly at ease. Now watch as it expands beyond the boundaries of the body and continues outward, and just imagine or just watch as it continues to expand. If it's helpful, you can think about it in terms of the space that you're in, the town, the country, the world, whatever helps with that idea of expansion in every direction. Just watch as that happens, and now let go of that image, allowing that feeling of space to remain, and for a moment let go of any focus, any image, and just let the mind do whatever it wants to do. Then bring the attention back to the body again, just coming back to that feeling of contact, noticing the sounds around you, and when you're ready, gently open the eyes again. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

Let me prepare the right practice for you.</speak>","weight": 0}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<speak> Thank you for joining me for this meditation. This meditation is useful when we have those moments in which we feel alone. This can be a really all encompassing feeling that has other emotions like fear and sadness wrapped up in there as well. As you take a few moments to get comfortable and ready for this meditation, allow yourself to be reminded that all of these feelings are valid. They remind us of our humanity. Be comforted that many people feel this way, and ironically, you are not alone in your feelings of aloneness. There are so many reasons and situations that can make us feel as if we are alone, and it's very easy for us to look at our experiences and say it isn't that bad, I shouldn't be feeling this lonely. What these feelings are asking you to do is to listen and acknowledge without pushing them down or away. What's important is that we continue our movement without getting stuck in a loop of these feelings. This can take time and practice, and it's okay if you're not there yet. Be gentle and compassionate with yourself. Everything happens in its own time. As we look outside of ourselves, it is very easy to experience disconnection as we navigate a world that feels as if it is moving further and further away from deep and meaningful connection with others. It is in these moments that we have a beautiful opportunity to reconnect to self, to our deepest, most true version, and remind ourselves that we are not alone in our own company. If you're in your comfortable meditation position now, you can close your eyes. Let's just bring awareness to our breath, noticing the in breath and the out breaths as they flow, noticing the parts of our bodies that are lifted on the inhale, and the parts of our bodies that are brought back to center on the exhale. For this meditation, we are not going to try and change the pattern of our breath. We just allow ourselves to accept what is without judgment. This is your breath, how it moves is unique to you, and we respect that in this moment. Feel your breath stretching out across your body, lifting, changing, bringing back home, seeking out the tired, tense parts of you, and bringing fresh oxygen, fresh life, to any of your worn corners. Begin to really feel the rhythm of your breath, letting your mind focus on this, allowing thoughts, worries, and fears to be soothed by this ancient beat. If it feels comfortable, you can try placing a hand on your chest, bringing your attention and your breath into your heart space, seeing if you can feel the gentle rising and falling of your chest with every inhale and exhale. Notice the beating of your heart. If your thoughts start to move towards the future or bring you back into the past, see if you can bring yourself back to your breath, back to the beating of your heart, back to the present moment. In this moment, see if you can turn towards the place of loneliness, letting your breath steady you. Here, in this space, we can sit with the loneliness together. Instead of trying to push it down or run away from it, you and I can sit with it, even if it's just for a minute. Can you feel it in your body? Does it change the beat of your heart? Does it change the rise and fall of your breath? Is this loneliness quiet, or is it loud? Breathing deeply into these feelings, remembering compassion, remembering gentleness and kindness for yourself in this moment, letting the breath wash over the loneliness, soothing its rough edges. And here in this moment, we give ourselves permission to begin to let go. We let go of the stories that the loneliness tells us about ourselves, often told in the voices of others. We let go of the expectations of others, and instead allow ourselves to nurture the intuitive spaces within us that know we are not alone. We let go of what we are told we should be doing, in favor of what feels right in our body, our soul, and our highest self. We let go of any worry or fear that we deserve this loneliness, this disconnection. Breathing deeply into that heart space, what if we could speak love to our loneliness? What if we could give our own pain compassion? How does it feel when you hear these words? Imagine if you could speak to your loneliness as you might to a good friend or someone who you deeply love. What would you say? Think about filling your heart space with love, compassion, understanding, and nurturing with every breath. Turn that loving energy that you give to others inward. Let it flow to all of the dark corners, the rough edges, the places that loneliness hides, bringing all your breath and your attention into your heart center. And from this heart space, with our breath, even in the face of all of that loneliness, we let ourselves remember gratitude. We let gratitude weave its way through us, every breath reminding us we may feel alone but we are still worthy. We may feel alone but we are also kind. We may feel alone but we are always up for exploring how things could change. We may feel alone for a moment, a day, a season, but nothing is permanent. We have ourselves, we have compassion, we have kindness. Take a few deep breaths here, <break time='4s'/> big full inhales, <break time='4s'/> big full exhales. <break time='4s'/> Be gentle with yourself as you navigate big feelings. Remember the words that you spoke to your loneliness from that place of a loving heart. This meditation will be here for you whenever you need someone to sit and face the loneliness with you. Thank you so much for sitting and meditating with me, friends. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

You want a long meditation practice for Reliefing Loneliness. Let me prepare the right practice for you.</speak>","weight": 0}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<speak> If you have ever felt lost in loneliness, then you know how difficult it is to shake this feeling. Luckily, when you combine desire with dedication, amazing changes in your life occur. Daily meditation is simple, yet powerful. Implementing a task and sticking to it is how we make habits. Loneliness is simply a feeling that has become habit. It cannot be cured by any external means. Your life could be full of people, and you still feel lonely. You could have no friends and feel lonesomeness. You could be completely alone and feel lonely. As you see, it is simply a thought of separation that creates the feeling of loneliness. This can have a never ending circling effect, until you change your focus. Find a very comfortable position and make sure you will not be disturbed. So let's begin by acknowledging the person who needs you the most. You will find this person when you look in a mirror. Say to yourself now thank you for this moment as an opportunity. Give yourself now, the time to breathe your very best. For most of us we go entire days without even thinking about our breath, yet it is the very thing keeping us alive. Your breath has been there for you since the beginning, fitting to each moment exactly as it needs. The breath never asks questions, and it never judges you. It simply does what is required, instantaneously. Let's honor our breath now, and all it has been doing for us, with 5 significant and purposeful breaths together. One, fully inhale, expanding your belly and chest as much as you can. Holding it for a moment. <break time='4s'/> And exhale, feeling a wave of relaxation sweep over you. <break time='4s'/> Two, inhale, filling your entire breathing system with fresh oxygen. Hold it. <break time='4s'/> And exhale, noticing again that wave of relaxation gently sweeping over you. <break time='4s'/> Three, inhale, very deeply so that you are brimming with air. Taking a moment at the top to soaking in the life force we call oxygen. <break time='4s'/> And exhale, noticing your body relaxing in different areas, without any effort from you. <break time='4s'/> Four, fully inhale the life force, beginning to feel these breaths purifying your entire body. <break time='4s'/> Exhaling now, not having to do anything at all. <break time='4s'/> Just notice how you are feeling. And five, last one, a full, beautiful breath coming in. hold it, feeling the goodness of this simple task. <break time='4s'/> And exhale, allowing that wave of relaxation to sweep, again over you. <break time='4s'/> Just take note of how you are feeling in this very moment. You now have an abundance of oxygen. This is how we were truly created to feel. Breathing deeply and fully is an expression of self compassion. Let your breath be natural now and notice how abundance feels. Good. This is your new tool that you use when faced with feelings of negativity and loneliness. Take five deep, purposeful, and helpful breaths. That allow you to relax. These conscious and dedicated breaths even make it difficult for you to think negatively. Next time you catch yourself, feeling hopeless, you must take these five healing breaths. There are many meditative techniques that give you back the reins, allowing you to take control of your emotions, instead of letting your emotions control you. Mindfulness though meditation helps you become better acquainted with yourself, and your emotions. So presently you are just relaxing and feeling very safe of comfortable. No one needs you right now, this is time you have dedicated to yourself, and nothing is disturbing you. You have nowhere to go and nothing you have to do right now. You are completely safe and relaxed and are able to make great changes without much effort. You are now being guided by your relaxation. Good. It's amazing how our feelings come and go, like waves on the ocean shore. We all know that there is absolutely nothing wrong with feeling relaxed, so it is just the same as there's nothing wrong with feeling uncomfortable. These are only sensations that you are experiencing. Sensations that come and go, come and go. Now, gently bring into your awareness the feeling of loneliness, and notice how and where any sensations of discomfort arise. Be with this feeling, as if you are with a friend who is very upset about something that's happened to them. Be there for your discomfort, as if you are consoling a dear friend who has tears in their eyes. Join with your loneliness as if you are meeting up someone you love because they called you and needed you. Is the feeling of loneliness actually scary? Or is it just like a friend, who is experiencing a bad day, and is calling out for someone to console them? You soothe your friend's tears with your compassion, the same as you soothe lonesome feelings. Be present and listen, because you are the only one who can give solace to this feeling, just as how your friend reached out to only you when they needed comfort. You alleviate feelings of desolation by being there. With them, and never pushing them away. Would you tell your troubled friend to go away when they call you, upset, and asking for your presence? No. Then you do not tell your loneliness to go away either. Good, now allow any feelings of seclusion, discomfort or pain to just pass by, like a rain cloud that has bought a heavy rain. The cloud passes by, and the sun peeks out, beaming with light and warmth. When you console uncomfortable feelings, and sit with them as a friend, you are allowing a storm of upset to rain down, letting go, and then continue in the wind, seeing the sun break though, drying up the waters with its warmth. You can clearly see a smile on your friend's face because you are always there for them. Good. The cure for loneliness is to change our focus, as soon as you feel it arise. Practicing these necessary techniques make for meaningful encounters with your inner self, allowing your loneliness to become your ally. Thank you and good job today. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

If you've ever felt lost in loneliness, then you know how difficult it is to shake that feeling. Luckily, when you combine desire with dedication, amazing changes in your life occur. Daily meditation is simple yet powerful. Implementing a task and sticking to it is how we form new habits. Loneliness is simply a feeling that has become a habit. It cannot be cured by any external means. Your life could be full of people and you still feel lonely. You could have no friends and feel lonesome. You could be completely alone and feel lonely. As you see, it's simply a thought of separation that creates the feeling of loneliness. This can have a never ending circling effect until you change your focus. So let's begin. Find a very comfortable position, making sure you won't be disturbed, and we start by acknowledging the person who needs you the most. You will find this person when you look in the mirror. Say to yourself now, thank you for this moment as an opportunity. Give yourself now the time to breathe your very best. For most of us, we go entire days without even thinking about our breath, yet it's the very thing keeping us alive. Your breath has been there for you since the beginning, fitting to each moment exactly as it needs. The breath never asks questions, and it never judges you. It simply does what is required, instantaneously, automatically. Let's honor our breath now and all it's been doing for us with five significant and purposeful breaths together. One, fully inhale, <break time='4s'/> expanding your belly and chest as best you can, holding it for a moment at the top of the breath, and then exhale, <break time='4s'/> feeling a wave of relaxation sweep over you. Two, inhale again, <break time='4s'/> filling your entire breathing system with fresh oxygen, hold it, and then exhale, <break time='4s'/> noticing again that wave of relaxation gently sweeping over you. Three, inhale very deeply so that you're brimming with air, <break time='4s'/> taking a moment at the top to soak in the life force we call oxygen, and then exhale, <break time='4s'/> noticing your body relaxing in different areas without any effort from you. Four, fully inhale the life force, <break time='4s'/> beginning to feel these breaths purifying your entire body, exhaling now, <break time='4s'/> not having to do anything at all but just notice how you're feeling. And five, last one, a full beautiful breath in, hold it, <break time='4s'/> feeling the goodness of this simple task, and exhale, <break time='4s'/> allowing that wave of relaxation to sweep over you once again. Just take note of how you're feeling in this very moment. You now have an abundance of oxygen. This is how we were truly created to feel. Breathing deeply and fully is an expression of self-compassion. Let your breath be more natural now, and just notice how abundance feels. Good. This is your new tool that you use when faced with feelings of negativity and loneliness. Take five deep, purposeful, and helpful breaths that allow you to relax. These conscious and dedicated breaths even make it difficult for you to think negatively. Next time you catch yourself feeling hopeless, you must take these five healing breaths. There are many meditative techniques that give you back the reins, allowing you to take control of your emotions instead of letting your emotions control you. Mindfulness through meditation helps you become better acquainted with yourself and your emotions. So presently you are just relaxing and feeling very safe and comfortable. No one needs you right now. This is time you have dedicated to yourself, and nothing is disturbing you. You have nowhere to go and nothing you have to do. Right now, you are completely safe and relaxed and are able to make great changes without much effort. You are now being guided by your relaxation. It's amazing how our feelings come and go like waves on the ocean shore. We all know that there's absolutely nothing wrong with feeling relaxed, so it's just the same as there's nothing wrong with feeling uncomfortable. These are only sensations that you're experiencing, sensations that come and go, and come and go. Now gently bring into your awareness the feeling of loneliness and notice how and where any sensations of discomfort arise. Be with this feeling as if you're with a friend who's very upset about something that's happened to them. Be there for your discomfort as if you're consoling a dear friend who has tears in their eyes. Join with your loneliness as if you're meeting up with someone you love because they called you and need you. Is the feeling of loneliness actually scary, or is it just like a friend who's experiencing a bad day and is calling out for someone to console them? You soothe your friend's tears with your compassion the same as you soothe lonesome feelings. Be present and listen because you are the only one who can give solace to this feeling, just as how your friend reached out to only you when they needed comfort. You alleviate feelings of desolation by being there with them and never pushing them away. Would you tell your troubled friend to go away when they call you upset and asking for your presence? No, then you don't tell your loneliness to go away either. Good. Now allow any feelings of seclusion, discomfort, or pain to just pass by, like a rain cloud that has brought a heavy rain. The cloud passes by and the sun peeks out, beaming with light and warmth. When you console uncomfortable feelings and sit with them as a friend, you're allowing a storm of upset to rain down, letting go, and then continue in the wind, seeing the sun break through, drying up the waters with its warmth. You can clearly see a smile on your friend's face because you are always there for them. The cure for loneliness is to change our focus as soon as you feel it arise. Practicing these necessary techniques makes for meaningful encounters with your inner self, allowing your loneliness to become your ally. And now, taking one more deep breath, <break time='4s'/> grounding yourself back into the present moment, as you exhale gently and slowly, allowing your eyes to open. <break time='4s'/> Thanks for joining me for this meditation today. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

You want a long meditation practice for Reliefing Loneliness. Let me prepare the right practice for you.</speak>","weight": 0}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<speak> Let's begin. Close your eyes and start to relax your body. Take a moment to just sit quietly, resting, breathe, all you need to do right now is breathe. Allow the air to move in and out slowly, naturally, your own pace. Allow a sense of quiet in your mind, restful and calm. Remind yourself that you have nothing else you need to do right now and that all you need to do is breathe. Release any tension in your neck and shoulders, let these muscles relax, let your shoulders drop into a relaxed position. Rest your hands in your lap or at your side, open your hands slightly, releasing any tension and relaxing your grip. Let your hands go limp, totally relaxed. Relax your hands as if you're letting go. Not only are you letting go of any physical grasp and allowing your hands to unclench, imagine also letting go of any feelings of tension. Release any feelings of tension or stress, choosing not to hold on to them, just relax. Notice any areas in your body where your muscles are tense and purposely allow these areas to relax. Consciously release tension from your muscles, the muscles loosen and go limp. For the next few moments, notice your body, and wherever you become aware of tension, release it. Allow your body to relax, keep breathing, and notice how every breath of air sustains you. Each time you breathe out, release tension with the air leaving your body, breathe the tension away until all your muscles are relaxed. Allow your body to be fully relaxed, encourage a feeling of calm and serenity. Let your mind relax as you purposely choose to take this time for your health. Anytime you notice any worries or tension, remind yourself all you have to do right now is just breathe and just relax. Now let's move on to the next step in this guided imagery process. Here we will acknowledge feelings of loneliness. I know this feels like the opposite of what you would want to do for overcoming loneliness, but this step is crucial. The way the mind works, if we acknowledge an emotion, the feeling loses its power to keep us stuck. By acknowledging loneliness, you're facing it and thereby taking charge of your emotions. This isn't easy, and it's not always comfortable, but it is very important. Before exploring your emotions, remind yourself that you're safe, your feelings are normal, emotions are neither good nor bad, they just are. Emotions are part of being human. If we numb the negative feelings, we numb the positive ones too. By acknowledging emotions, you live the experience of being a human with all the highs and lows, triumphs and challenges. You can overcome this, and you're going to be stronger as a result. Now focus on being relaxed and calm as you become aware of your emotions. Notice the emotions that are there. They may be strong, or they may be subtle, just notice for a few moments. Become aware of your emotions, however you are feeling right now is okay. Good or bad, your emotions are valid. There's a wide range of normal responses to this act of noticing emotions. Some people find that they feel kind of neutral, and it might be difficult to identify particular feelings. Others can notice some different feelings that may be in the background or on the surface. Some people find that they become tearful in response to a feeling that comes up, good or bad, and it is possible to feel something or to cry even if you aren't sure what the feeling is or why you're reacting that way. Whatever your experience, it is okay. There is no right or wrong way to feel. Sit with these feelings for a few moments, just absorbing how you feel. You don't need to try to change anything, just notice. Keep breathing calmly as you observe. As you can continue to absorb your feelings, consider feelings of loneliness. Do you notice any feelings of loneliness? Observe these feelings, notice your body as you pay attention to your emotions. Where in your body do you experience loneliness? What physical feelings do you notice? Take a moment now to acknowledge how you feel. Acknowledging means recognizing, being aware, and mentally accepting the presence of your feelings. If you're experiencing loneliness, acknowledge this feeling. It might be helpful to say to yourself silently in your mind, I am feeling lonely. You can name the emotions or just observe the feelings. It is okay if you aren't sure what they are. Just acknowledge your emotions. Go ahead now and mentally acknowledge your feelings, including any feelings of loneliness or other emotions, in a way that feels right to you. Just relax now, focus on breathing for a few moments, nothing else but breathing. Now let's use cognitive behavioral therapy techniques to overcome feelings of loneliness. Think for a moment about loneliness, and as you do, notice the thoughts that arise. This could be things like, I'm all alone or I have no one to rely on or no one cares about me. What kind of thoughts come up for you? Thoughts lead to emotions, and if you're like most people, you probably have some negative thoughts. I'm not going to ask you to change your negative thoughts into positives, that would be unrealistic and not helpful. Instead, let's examine ways to make negative thoughts more realistic. This is a CBT technique that can be very helpful for overcoming loneliness. Let's start with some common thoughts related to loneliness and work on making them more realistic. I'm all alone. This is a common thought, especially at a time when you may be feeling physically and socially isolated. How could this thought be made more realistic? Try a few options. I am living alone, and I can still connect with others over the phone. I am not seeing anyone in person right now, but I can still be connected through letters, emails, and phone calls, and I look forward to seeing others in person when I'm able. Now let's consider I have no one to rely on. If you can think of even one other person you could rely on, the statement would not be entirely true. How could this thought be made more realistic? Here are some ideas for reframing, I have no one to rely on, to be more realistic. Although I feel alone sometimes, I do have people I can count on for support. I can rely on my doctor for medical help when I need it. I can rely on my relative, friend, or neighbor to answer the phone when I call. Finally, let's consider the thought, no one cares about me. What would be a more realistic thought? Here are some suggested realistic thoughts. There are many people who love and care about me. I am very important to my friend, neighbor, relative, and pet. Your thoughts may be different than these, but the process is the same. Consider alternative ways of thinking that might be more realistic. Notice that when we feel lonely, we tend to think isolated, lonely thoughts. Notice that these thoughts might seem true, but if we examine them, they might not be completely supported by evidence. Even if you can find one bit of evidence to the contrary, this evidence can start to change your thinking so that your thinking becomes more realistic. Take a moment now to think about ways to modify your own thoughts to be as realistic as possible and to emphasize more of the positive, empowering thoughts. You have made it through the most challenging part of this overcoming loneliness guided imagery exercise, you did it. The rest of the exercise is focused on positive and empowering thoughts. Remember that feeling lonely is okay, this feeling has a purpose. The purpose of loneliness is to encourage you to reach out for connection. When you feel lonely, think about just one small way you could reach out. Could you write a card or a letter for someone you know or for a stranger? Could you call someone? Could you join an online group or discussion board with people with whom you have something in common? Others may not realize that you're feeling lonely, they might be lonely too. Is there someone you could contact and admit that you're feeling lonely? A simple invitation such as, I'm feeling lonely lately, could we talk, can really change things. Let's end this exercise with some positive thoughts to overcome loneliness. You can just listen to these statements, or you can repeat the ones that are meaningful to you by changing you to I to make them personal. You are a valuable, worthwhile human being. It is normal to feel lonely sometimes. You are connected to others, even if the connections do not feel strong right now. Loneliness has a purpose, it is to remind you to reach out to others. It is okay to be by yourself, solitude can be very positive and enjoyable. There are people who care about you. You have purpose and value. You can connect with others by all the ways you can contribute. Talking to people is just one way to connect, you can act by giving your time, talent, and resources as well. Connection from afar is meaningful and important. Even when you feel lonely, you are not alone. Many people are feeling the same things as you are. There are others like you. All humans feel lonely at times. Your feelings are valid. You have the ability to influence your feelings. By doing things to make connections, you can feel more connected. You can make a phone call. You can write a comment and post it for someone online. You can send a message or an email. You can share a positive picture or quote. There are many ways that you can influence the world for the better. You matter. You are important. You are valued. Think of one thing you can do in the next twenty four hours to be more connected to at least one other person and make a commitment to yourself to do it. You are taking steps to overcome loneliness. Just relax now, let any tension go, let your muscles become loose, allow your mind to rest. You have done the hard work and can now just relax. As you conclude this exercise, remember that your feelings are normal, little glimmers of positive feelings can grow, and you can continue to take steps to make the positive feelings stronger. You have already done this exercise and have accomplished this significant step. Recall the feelings of relaxation as you allowed your muscles to let go of any tension. Keep the feelings of relaxation with you as you return to your usual activities, feeling empowered. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

Welcome. Today we're going to meditate on loneliness. This meditation is designed to offer some thoughts on being lonely, on how we might improve our situation or at least improve our outlook on the situation where we find ourselves feeling alone. Start by getting settled in a comfortable seated position. Your posture should be straight but relaxed. Take care to relax the muscles in your shoulders, neck, and jaw. Close your eyes and begin to move your attention to your breath. Feel your breath as it goes in and out of your lungs. Notice the rhythm of your breath, the depth of the breath. Right now all you need to do is notice, be aware, just notice the breath. Allow all other thoughts to fade away as you focus on your breath. Good, now take a deep breath as deep as you can, <break time='4s'/> and as you do, imagine that any stress or tension in your body is drawn into your lung space. Now exhale fully and forcefully with a big breath, <break time='4s'/> releasing all the tension. Once more for good measure, deep breath in, <break time='4s'/> fully fill the lungs, and exhale and release any remaining tension. <break time='4s'/> Good, now keep on breathing nice and deep. Any time in this meditation you find yourself distracted or overwhelmed, you can always center yourself back in your breath. Today we're going to meditate on loneliness. If you've chosen this meditation today, you probably don't need to be told how loneliness feels. You're probably already feeling it, but it's always good to be mindful and conscious of how you're feeling. So take a few moments and clear your mind of any stray thoughts, anything on your to do list, any worries or stresses, and begin to acknowledge your feelings of loneliness. Notice exactly how that feels. Notice the thoughts that go with it. Become aware of the feeling. Even though it might feel somewhat uncomfortable to focus on a negative feeling like loneliness or sadness, it's important to acknowledge the feeling so that it can be worked through and released. Think about where the feelings of loneliness seem to reside in your body. Imagine that your feelings of loneliness or isolation are transformed into a blue light within your body. You may feel it in your head, in your heart, or in your gut. Your first instinct is usually right. Where do you feel this feeling right now? Take a moment to recognize it and to allow your visualization to develop. Good, now imagine that you're looking at yourself and parts of your body are lit up with a blue light of loneliness just as you've been visualizing. Imagine you see yourself and around you, other people begin to appear. These are people in your life. You can imagine family and friends or work colleagues or even people you meet online. You'll see people you know well and some you don't know well at all. You might see the barista at your favorite coffee shop, the receptionist at your office, your mom, your best friend, your cousin, the neighbor from two doors down, anyone and everyone who you want to surround yourself with, anyone who comes to mind. Don't try to exclude people. If they come to mind, you should feel free to add them to your visualization. Now you should see yourself surrounded by people. You may feel very close to all of them or none of them. Either is okay. There's no wrong choice here in your meditation, but as you see all these people, begin to imagine that a thin red thread connects you to them. It spans from the center of your heart to theirs. Some of the bonds are so strong and clear as to be nearly indestructible, some are fainter, but the connection is there regardless. Imagine now that you're connected to so many that a bright light begins to shine from every heart. It travels along the threads to connect you. That begins to light up your heart. As it does, all the places within you that were filled with the blue light of loneliness begin to change. The light turns from somber blue to bright, warm golden light. Picture watching that color change and as you do, you also feel aware of the warmth and love. You realize that though we all feel alone from time to time, we're still surrounded by other people. We're connected in more ways than we recognize. Everyone feels alone from time to time, but even that feeling can connect us. You're connected, heart to heart, to so many. It's easy to lose sight of these beautiful red threads of connection, but they're always there. Now allow the visualization to fade and come back to your breath, deep and steady, always there for you to center yourself, to allow you to clear your mind. And now, in order to feel even more connected, I want you to spend just a few minutes sending love to those around you. Often when we're feeling lonely and disconnected, our focus is on our desire to receive love and attention from others. When we experience these feelings, the best course of action is not to wait for others to notice how we feel and to make us all better. The better course of action is to put out the energy of love, attention, and affection to others in our lives. Do unto others, as they say. So begin by thinking of a single person or a group of people in your life that you'd like to send love to. You may choose to visualize your immediate family or your group of friends, your parents, or you may try the more difficult but incredibly rewarding practice of sending loving-kindness to all people, even those you don't know or don't care for. Settle into your breath, feel it in your chest, and notice your heart beating. Begin to allow a feeling of gentle goodwill, of kindness and acceptance, to grow from the space around your heart. Allow it to grow and grow, direct it towards your chosen recipients, love, peace, kindness, a wish that their lives are happy and that they are successful in their endeavors, that they're not in pain or fear, that they feel loved and accepted in their life, that they are supported. Imagine sending this feeling out to them. Allow it to grow and grow, to let your heart swell and fill. Send it out generally like a beam of light. Imagine the people you wish to direct this feeling towards and that they receive this loving kindness as if you're presenting them with a gift. Good, now begin to allow any visualizations to fade. Come back to your breath, in and out. <break time='4s'/> Notice how your feelings have changed. Notice any lessening in your feeling of loneliness or sadness. It may be that you've completely lost those feelings, or the feeling may just be dulled a bit. Either is okay. Just be aware of what's true for you. Continue to breathe deeply and allow your whole focus to move to the breath, in and out. <break time='4s'/> Inhale and exhale. <break time='4s'/> Now begin to become more conscious of your body. Feel the weight of your body pressing into the ground or the chair where you sit. Feel the air at your skin. Feel the movement of your chest as you breathe in and out. <break time='4s'/> One more deep breath in and out, <break time='4s'/> and when you're ready, open your eyes. We have reached the end of the guided part of this meditation. Gently bring yourself back from your bubble, come out slowly. If you want, continue meditating on your own time. </speak>","weight": 1}]}

It is possible to be lonely even when other people are around. A feeling of loneliness signifies an unmet need. Dealing with loneliness can be difficult, but a good first step is to face the feeling. Before you deal with loneliness, begin by becoming more relaxed. Choose a comfortable position, and take a few moments just to breathe. Allow yourself to breathe slowly and naturally, doing nothing else in this moment besides concentrating on your breaths. Breathe in and out, <break time='4s'/> allowing each breath to calm and relax you. Continue breathing calmly, at whatever pace is comfortable for you. Let's use mental focus to help you relax. All you need to do is count up from one to five, then back down to one. I'll count with you for a while, and then you can count on your own. Try to count in time with your breathing, counting each time you breathe out. One, <break time='4s'/> two, <break time='4s'/> three, <break time='4s'/> four, <break time='4s'/> five, <break time='4s'/> four, <break time='4s'/> three, <break time='4s'/> two, <break time='4s'/> one, <break time='4s'/> two, <break time='4s'/> three, <break time='4s'/> four, <break time='4s'/> five, <break time='4s'/> four, <break time='4s'/> three, <break time='4s'/> two, <break time='4s'/> one. <break time='4s'/> Keep counting on your own now. Allow your muscles to become relaxed and loose, and focus completely on the numbers, becoming more and more relaxed with each number, more deeply relaxed. Now let's start to deal with loneliness. Think for a moment about how you are feeling. Notice any feelings of loneliness you may have. What does the loneliness feel like? Some people experience a heavy feeling in the stomach or a feeling of emptiness or aching in the chest. What does loneliness feel like to you? You don't need to start dealing with the loneliness just yet, simply experience it, noticing what it is like. Loneliness is an unpleasant feeling, but stay with this feeling for a few more moments. You do not need to deal with loneliness yet, just notice the feeling. This lonely feeling you are experiencing can be a signal that you have needs that are not being met right now. Your mind is speaking to you through this feeling, telling you that something needs to change, whether your situation, your outlook, or your actions. You can use this feeling of loneliness to explore what it is that you need, and to make changes to deal with loneliness so you can feel content. Concentrate on the feeling of loneliness. What are you thinking about when you focus on the loneliness? Perhaps you have images in your mind of ways that you want your life to be different. Maybe you are thinking about being alone. Maybe you miss someone. What thoughts or images go through your mind as you focus on being lonely? There are two solutions to deal with loneliness. One is to increase the connections and contact you have with others. The other way to deal with loneliness is to have a positive relationship with yourself, and appreciate your company. Both of these remedies are available to you. You can use both, without having to choose one or the other. To start to deal with loneliness, let's focus for a moment on connections with people. Maybe you are feeling lonely right now because you are by yourself, with no one else around, or you could be feeling lonely even with others around, if you do not feel sufficiently connected to the person or people around you. Think about how many times you connected with another person in the past week. If you were to guess as to how many connections you had, what would the number be? We have connections with many people on various levels. Connections can range from a simple acknowledgment, for example, saying hello to a stranger or to the person who works in the grocery store, to close relationships. Think about the past week, and remember the people you interacted with. Did you have any telephone conversations? Did you read or send any emails? Did you say hello to anyone in the store? Did you read or write any letters? Did you visit with any friends? Think about the number of connections you had in the past week. Were there more connections than you expected, or were there less? Did you have enough close connections, or were they mostly with strangers or acquaintances? Are you just feeling lonely today, or were you lonely for the rest of this past week, too? Everyone feels lonely sometimes. Loneliness is a normal, natural feeling that we all experience. All people deal with loneliness at some time in their lives. This feeling helps to push us to interact more, to get closer to people, to risk in order to have close relationships. In this way, loneliness can be a good thing. What is your feeling of loneliness pushing you to do? To deal with loneliness, you need to address what the feeling pushes you to do. Do you need to join a group or a club to deal with loneliness? Do you need to deal with loneliness by phoning a friend you haven't spoken with in a long time? To deal with loneliness by increasing connections with people, you may need to seek out company and communication. Think about people you could call to talk to, or people you could go see face to face. If no one comes to mind, consider places where you could meet new people. Support groups are a great way to meet and connect with others, and so are clubs, or classes. Think of all the places you could spend time with people. Relationships do not always have to be face-to-face to be satisfying. Internet support groups can be very helpful, and you can access them right from your home. Think of one thing you can do, within the next twenty-four hours, to deal with loneliness and help you feel more connected with people. What is your loneliness pushing you to do? Choose one action you can take to deal with loneliness, and make a plan to do this action within the next twenty-four hours. Now let's deal with loneliness from another perspective. Regardless of how much contact and connection you have with others, it is essential to be content with your own company. How do you feel when you are alone? Do you find yourself to be good company? If you are not feeling content with your own company right now, this may translate into a feeling of loneliness. Concentrate on the loneliness, on the aching, empty feeling inside, and now imagine that feeling shifting, just slightly. Imagine a feeling of peace, contentment, happiness. Picture this feeling, as if it is a warm liquid. Imagine that the liquid can fill your body, pouring in through the top of your head, so warm and pleasant. Imagine this liquid filling your body, being poured down, filling up your feet, then your legs, rising higher, to your knees, to your hips. Feel the warmth filling the core of your body, up to your stomach, chest, all the way to your shoulders, pouring down to your hands and filling your arms, up to your elbows, to your upper arms. Feel the warmth filling your neck and your head, filling your whole body with a feeling of warmth and peace. Feel an even greater warmth beginning at the center of your stomach and radiating outward, as if the sun is shining inside you. Let this feeling of warmth and peace grow, experiencing a feeling of happiness inside. Feel the warmth growing, growing, until joy is radiating from you, as if your whole body is shining, glowing, radiating joy and happiness. Inside you feel full, solid, filled with contentment. Imagine any remaining feelings of emptiness being crowded out completely by the warmth inside you. Inside you feel full, solid, filled with contentment. Imagine any remaining feelings of emptiness being crowded out completely by the warmth inside you. When you are so content, there is no room for emptiness. Allow yourself to feel peaceful and serene, even for just a few moments. Right now, everything is as it should be. You are perfectly okay, just as you are. You feel joyful, loved, surrounded by warmth. You are worth all of the positive things that come your way. You have a lot to offer in relationships with others. Feel the happiness radiating from you, and imagine this joy shining forth, like the sun shining down on everyone around you.
